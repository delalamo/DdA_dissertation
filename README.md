# My PhD dissertation from Vanderbilt University (August 2021)

I completed my PhD research at Vanderbilt University from 2015-2021 in the laboratories of Jens Meiler and Hassane S. Mchaourab. This repository contains the source code for the entire dissertation, which was written in TeX at [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/). Everything was compiled with XeLaTeX. The templates files were designed by Eli Hooten, updated by Haley Adams, and made available by the University.

The contents are in the process of being published in scientific journals (last updated 7 May 2022):
