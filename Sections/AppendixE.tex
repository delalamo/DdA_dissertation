Left: Each of the rotamers in Rosettaâ€™s \gls{mtssl} rotamer library was converted into two coordinates: one representing the nitroxide ring center of mass (purple), which was used to evaluate clashes; and one representing the nitroxide bond midpoint (silver), from which distances were measured. Shown over PDB 2CUU residue 131. Right: Optimization scheme for reducing the number of measurement coordinates using experimental T4 Lysozyme distance data. One thousand replicates were performed for each of N clusters, with N ranging from 3 to 53 coordinates.}

Enrichment was quantified as the logarithm of the percentage of native-like models (top 10\% by $\mathrm{RMSD_{100SSE}}$) that were also in the top 10\% by score. An enrichment of 1 indicates that the set of models constituting the top 10\% by RosettaDEER score was identical to the set of models constituting the top 10\% by Rosetta score.}
