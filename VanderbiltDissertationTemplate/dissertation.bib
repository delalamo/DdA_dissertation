These transporters bind their ligands on one side of the membrane, and undergo a global conformational change to release them on the other side of the membrane. Over the last few years, crystal structures have captured several bacterial secondary transporters in different states along their transport cycle, providing insight into possible molecular mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent findings focusing on the emerging structural and mechanistic similarities between evolutionary diverse transporters. We also discuss the structural basis of substrate binding, ion coupling and inhibition viewed from the perspective of these similarities. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Single molecule and NMR measurements of protein dynamics increasingly uncover the complexity of binding scenarios. Here, we describe an extended conformational selection model that embraces a repertoire of selection and adjustment processes. Induced fit can be viewed as a subset of this repertoire, whose contribution is affected by the bond types stabilizing the interaction and the differences between the interacting partners. We argue that protein segments whose dynamics are distinct from the rest of the protein ('discrete breathers') can govern conformational transitions and allosteric propagation that accompany binding processes and, as such, might be more sensitive to mutational events. Additionally, we highlight the dynamic complexity of binding scenarios as they relate to events such as aggregation and signalling, and the crowded cellular environment. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most of the proteins in a cell assemble into complexes to carry out their function. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical properties as well as the evolution of interactions between proteins. The Protein Data Bank represents an important source of information for such studies, because more than half of the structures are homo- or heteromeric protein complexes. Here we propose the first hierarchical classification of whole protein complexes of known 3-D structure, based on representing their fundamental structural features as a graph. This classification provides the first overview of all the complexes in the Protein Data Bank and allows nonredundant sets to be derived at different levels of detail. This reveals that between one-half and two-thirds of known structures are multimeric, depending on the level of redundancy accepted. We also analyse the structures in terms of the topological arrangement of their subunits and find that they form a small number of arrangements compared with all theoretically possible ones. This is because most complexes contain four subunits or less, and the large majority are homomeric. In addition, there is a strong tendency for symmetry in complexes, even for heteromeric complexes. Finally, through comparison of Biological Units in the Protein Data Bank with the Protein Quaternary Structure database, we identified many possible errors in quaternary structure assignments. Our classification, available as a database and Web server at http://www.3Dcomplex.org, will be a starting point for future work aimed at understanding the structure and evolution of protein complexes. {\textcopyright}2006 Levy et al.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) are integral membrane proteins responsible for the sodium-dependent reuptake of smallmolecule neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. The symporters for the biogenic amines serotonin (SERT), dopamine (DAT), and norepinephrine (NET) are targets of multiple psychoactive agents, and their dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric ailments. LeuT, a thermostable eubacterial NSS homolog, has been exploited as a model protein for NSS members to canvass the conformational mechanism of transport with a combination of X-ray crystallography, cysteine accessibility, and solution spectroscopy. Despite yielding remarkable insights, these studies have primarily been conducted with protein in the detergent-solubilized state rather than embedded in a membrane mimic. In addition, solution spectroscopy has required site-specific labeling of nonnative cysteines, a labor-intensive process occasionally resulting in diminished transport and/or binding activity. Here, we overcome these limitations by reconstituting unlabeled LeuT in phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs, subjecting them to hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and facilitating interpretation of the data with molecular dynamics simulations. The data point to changes of accessibility and dynamics of structural elements previously implicated in the transport mechanism, in particular transmembrane helices (TMs) 1a and 7 as well as extracellular loops (ELs) 2 and 4. The results therefore illuminate the value of this strategy for interrogating the conformational mechanism of the more clinically significant mammalian membrane proteins including SERT and DAT, neither of which tolerates complete removal of endogenous cysteines, and whose activity is heavily influenced by neighboring lipids.},

Nevertheless, conventional techniques to structure determination attempt an inversion of the data by minimization of a target function. This approach leads to problems if the data are sparse, noisy, heterogeneous, or difficult to describe theoretically. We propose here to view biomolecular structure determination as an inference rather than an inversion problem. Probability theory then offers a consistent formalism to solve any structure determination problem: We use Bayes' theorem to derive a probability distribution for the atomic coordinates and all additional unknowns. This distribution represents the complete information contained in the data and can be analyzed numerically by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. We apply our method to data obtained from a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment and discuss the estimation of theory parameters. {\textcopyright}2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {An intensively investigated intermediate state of protein folding is the molten globule (MG) state, which contains secondary but hardly any tertiary structure. In previous work, we have determined the distances between interacting spins within maltose binding protein (MBP) in its native state using continuous wave and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Seven double mutants had been employed to investigate the structure within the two domains of MBP. DEER data nicely corroborated the previously available X-ray data. Even in its MG state, MBP is known to still bind its ligand maltose. We therefore hypothesized that there must be a defined structure around the binding pocket of MBP already in the absence of tertiary structure. Here we have investigated the functional and structural difference between native and MG state in the open and closed form with a new set of MBP mutants. In these, the spin-label positions were placed near the active site. Binding of its ligands leads to a conformational change from open to closed state, where the two domains are more closely together. The complete set of MBP mutants was analyzed at pH 3.2 (MG) and pH 7.4 (native state) using double-quantum coherence EPR. The values were compared with theoretical predictions of distances between the labels in biradicals constructed by molecular modeling from the crystal structures of MBP in open and closed form and were found to be in excellent agreement. Measurements show a defined structure around the binding pocket of MBP in MG, which explains maltose binding. A new and important finding is that in both states ligand-free MBP can be found in open and closed form, while ligand-bound MBP appears only in closed form because of maltose binding.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein is known to play a causative role in Parkinson disease. Although its physiological functions are not fully understood, $\alpha$-synuclein has been shown to interact with synaptic vesicles and modulate neurotransmitter release. However, the structure of its physiologically relevant membrane-bound state remains unknown. Here we developed a site-directed spin labeling and EPR-based approach for determining the structure of $\alpha$-synuclein bound to a lipid bilayer. Continuous-wave EPR was used to assign local secondary structure and to determine the membrane immersion depth of lipid-exposed residues, whereas pulsed EPR was used to map long-range distances. The structure of $\alpha$-synuclein was built and refined by using simulated annealing molecular dynamics restrained by the immersion depths and distances. We found that $\alpha$-synuclein forms an extended, curved $\alpha$-helical structure that is over 90 aa in length. The monomeric helix has a superhelical twist similar to that of right-handed coiled-coils which, like $\alpha$-synuclein, contain 11-aa repeats, but which are soluble, oligomeric proteins (rmsd = 0.82 {\AA}). The $\alpha$-synuclein helix extends parallel to the curved membrane in a manner that allows conserved Lys and Glu residues to interact with the zwitterionic headgroups, while uncharged residues penetrate into the acyl chain region. This structural arrangement is significantly different from that of $\alpha$-synuclein in the presence of the commonly used membrane-mimetic detergent SDS, which induces the formation of two antiparallel helices. Our structural analysis emphasizes the importance of studying membrane protein structure in a bilayer environment. {\textcopyright}2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

For this, we provide a general mathematical framework and its open-source software implementation. We extend an earlier approach by Edwards and Stoll for the selection of an optimal regularization parameter to all of these penalties and use their big test data set of noisy DEER traces with known ground truth for assessment. The results indicate that regularization methods based on Bregman iterations provide an improvement upon Tikhonov regularization in recognizing features and recovering distribution width at moderate signal-to-noise ratio, provided that noise variance is known. Bregman-iterative methods are robust with respect to the method used in the choice of regularization parameter.},

abstract = {As many key proteins evade crystallization and remain too large for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy combined with site-directed spin labeling offers an alternative approach for obtaining structural information. Such information must be translated into geometric restraints to be used in computer simulations. Here, distances between spin labels are converted into distance ranges between $\beta$ carbons by using a "motion-on-a-cone" model, and a linear-correlation model links spin-label accessibility to the number of neighboring residues. This approach was tested on T4-lysozyme and $\alpha$A-crystallin with the deÂ novo structure prediction algorithm Rosetta. The results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining highly accurate, atomic-detail models from EPR data by yielding 1.0 {\AA}and 2.6 {\AA}full-atom models, respectively. Distance restraints between amino acids far apart in sequence but close in space are most valuable for structure determination. The approach can be extended to other experimental techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, substituted cysteine accessibility method, or mutational studies. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite considerable progress, the molecular basis of subtype-specific ligand selectivity, especially for peptide receptors, remains unknown. Here, by integrating DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy with advanced molecular modeling and docking, the mechanism of the subtype selectivity of human bradykinin receptors for their peptide agonists has been resolved. The conserved middle segments of the bound peptides show distinct conformations that result in different presentations of their N and C termini toward their receptors. Analysis of the peptide-receptor interfaces reveals that the charged N-terminal residues of the peptides are mainly selected through electrostatic interactions, whereas the C-terminal segments are recognized via both conformations and interactions. The detailed molecular picture obtained by this approach opens a new gateway for exploring the complex conformational and chemical space of peptides and peptide analogs for designing GPCR subtype-selective biochemical tools and drugs.},

DEER is frequently applied to biological systems that have multiple conformational states leading to complex distance distributions. These complex distributions raise issues regarding the best approach to analyze DEER data. A widely used method utilizes a priori background correction followed by Tikhonov regularization. Unfortunately, the underlying assumptions of this approach can impact the analysis. In this chapter, a method of analyzing DEER data is presented that is ideally suited to obtain these complex distance distributions. The approach allows the fitting of raw experimental data without a priori background correction as well as the rigorous determination of uncertainties for all fitting parameters. This same methodological approach can be used for the simultaneous or global analysis of multiple DEER data sets using variable ratios of a common set of components, thus allowing direct correlation of distance components with functionally relevant conformational and biochemical states. Examples are given throughout to highlight this robust fitting approach.},

We demonstrate the feasibility of using this approach for the K+ channels KcsA and MVP and the amino acid transporter LeuT. We determine the crystal structure of the KcsA channel obtained by CFPS and in vitro folding to show the structural similarity to the cellular expressed KcsA channel and to establish the feasibility of using this two-step approach for membrane protein production for structural studies. Our studies show that the correct folding of these membrane proteins with complex topologies can take place in vitro without the involvement of the cellular machinery for membrane protein biogenesis.

abstract = {The proper understanding of biomolecular recognition mechanisms that take place in a drug target is of paramount importance to improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development. The intrinsic dynamic character of proteins has a strong influence on biomolecular recognition mechanisms and models such as conformational selection have been widely used to account for this dynamic association process. However, conformational changes occurring in the receptor prior and upon association with other molecules are diverse and not obvious to predict when only a few structures of the receptor are available. In view of the prominent role of protein flexibility in ligand binding and its implications for drug discovery, it is of great interest to identify receptor conformations that play a major role in biomolecular recognition before starting rational drug design efforts. In this review, we discuss a number of recent advances in computer-aided drug discovery techniques that have been proposed to incorporate receptor flexibility into structure-based drug design. The allowance for receptor flexibility provided by computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations or enhanced sampling techniques helps to improve the accuracy of methods used to estimate binding affinities and, thus, such methods can contribute to the discovery of novel drug leads. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many analyses published in the last decade suggest that enzymes isolated from cold-adapted organisms are characterized by a higher flexibility of their molecular structure. Recently, it has been argued that all cold-adapted enzymes with catalytic efficiency greater than that of their mesophilic counterparts display local flexibility or rigidity that are likely to cooperate, each acting on specific areas of the enzyme structure. Here we report an analysis of the normalized thermal B-factor distributions in psychrophilic proteins compared with those of their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts with the aim to detect statistically significant local variations of relative backbone flexibility possibly linked to cold adaptation. We utilized a strategy based mainly on intra-family comparison of local distribution of normalized B-factors. After careful statistical treatment of data, the picture emerging from our results suggests that the distribution of the flexibility in psychrophilic enzymes is locally more heterogeneous than in their respective mesophilic homologues. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The subunits of the dimeric enzyme aspartate aminotransferase have two domains: one large and one small. The active site lies in a cavity that is close to both the subunit interface and the interface between the two domains. On binding the substrate the domains close together. This closure completely buries the substrate in the active site and moves two arginine side-chains so they form salt bridges with carboxylate groups of the substrate. The salt bridges hold the substrate close to the pyridoxal 5â²-phosphate cofactor and in the right position and orientation for the catalysis of the transamination reaction. We describe here the structural changes that produce the domain movements and the closure of the active site. Structural changes occur at the interface between the domains and within the small domain itself. On closure, the core of the small domain rotates by 13 Â° relative to the large domain. Two other regions of the small domain, which form part of the active site, move somewhat differently. A loop, residues 39 to 49, above the active site moves about 1 {\AA}less than the core of the small domain. A helix within the small domain forms the "door" of the active site. It moves with the core of the small domain and, in addition, shifts by 1{\textperiodcentered}2 {\AA}, rotates by 10 Â°, and switches its first turn from the $\alpha$ to the 310 conformation. This results in the helix closing the active site. The domain movements are produced by a co-ordinated series of small changes. Within one subunit the polypeptide chain passes twice between the large and small domains. One link involves a peptide in an extended conformation. The second link is in the middle of a long helix that spans both domains. At the interface this helix is kinked and, on closure, the angle of the kink changes to accommodate the movement of the small domain. The interface between the domains is formed by 15 residues in the large domain packing against 12 residues in the small domain and the manner in which these residues pack is essentially the same in the open and closed structures. Domain movements involve changes in the main-chain and side-chain torsion angles in the residues on both sides of the interface. Most of these changes are small; only a few side-chains switch to new conformations. The result of these changes in conformation is to move interface residues in the small domain by between 0{\textperiodcentered}2 and 3{\textperiodcentered}3 {\AA}relative to the large domain and so produce the relative rotation of the two domains. In both the open and closed forms the interface residues are close packed and almost all have normally allowed conformations. {\textcopyright}1992.},

abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

abstract = {Partially folded proteins, characterized as exhibiting secondary structure elements with loose or absent tertiary contacts, represent important intermediates in both physiological protein folding and pathological protein misfolding. To aid in the characterization of the structural state(s) of such proteins, a novel structure calculation scheme is presented that combines structural restraints derived from pulsed EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The methodology is established for the protein $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$S), which exhibits characteristics of a partially folded protein when bound to a micelle of the detergent sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (SLAS). By combining 18 EPR-derived interelectron spin label distance distributions with NMR-based secondary structure definitions and bond vector restraints, interelectron distances were correlated and a set of theoretical ensemble basis populations was calculated. A minimal set of basis structures, representing the partially folded state of SLAS-bound $\alpha$S, was subsequently derived by back-calculating correlated distance distributions. A surprising variety of well-defined protein-micelle interactions was thus revealed in which the micelle is engulfed by two differently arranged antiparallel $\alpha$S helices. The methodology further provided the population ratios between dominant ensemble structural states, whereas limitation in obtainable structural resolution arose from spin label flexibility and residual uncertainties in secondary structure definitions. To advance the understanding of protein-micelle interactions, the present study concludes by showing that, in marked contrast to secondary structure stability, helix dynamics of SLAS-bound $\alpha$S correlate with the degree of protein-induced departures from free micelle dimensions. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

Within a single crystal, the oriented ensemble of spin bearing moieties results in a strong angle dependence of the EPR spectra. A quantitative description of the EPR spectra requires the determination of the unit cell orientation with respect to the sample tube and the orientation of the spin bearing moieties within the crystal lattice. Angle dependent EPR spectra were analyzed by line shape simulations using the stochastic Liouville equation approach developed by Freed and co-workers and an effective Hamiltonian approach. The gain in spectral information obtained from the EPR spectra of single crystalline samples taken at different frequencies, namely the X-band and Q-band, allows us to discriminate between motional models describing the spectra of isotropic solutions similarly well. In addition, it is shown that the angle dependent single crystal spectra allow us to identify two spin label rotamers with very similar side chain dynamics. These results demonstrate the utility of single crystal EPR spectroscopy in combination with spectral line shape simulation techniques to extract valuable dynamic information not readily available from the analysis of isotropic systems. In addition, it will be shown that the loss of electron density in high resolution diffraction experiments at room temperature does not allow us to conclude that there is significant structural disorder in the system.},

The outer vestibule is an important structurally extended region of KcsA in which toxins, blockers, and metal ions bind and modulate the gating behavior of K+ channels. Despite its functional significance, the gating-related structural dynamics at the outer vestibule are not well understood. Under steady-state conditions, inactivating WT and noninactivating E71A KcsA stabilize the nonconductive and conductive filter conformations upon opening the activation gate. Site-directed fluorescence polarization of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD)- labeled outer vestibule residues shows that the outer vestibule of open/conductive conformation is highly dynamic compared with the motional restriction experienced by the outer vestibule during inactivation gating. A wavelength-selective fluorescence approach shows a change in hydration dynamics in inactivated and noninactivated conformations, and supports a possible role of restricted/ bound water molecules in C-type inactivation gating. Using a unique restrained ensemble simulation method, along with distance measurements by EPR, we show that, on average, the outer vestibule undergoes a modest backbone conformational change during its transition to various functional states, although the structural dynamics of the outer vestibule are significantly altered during activation and inactivation gating. Taken together, our results support the role of a hydrogen bond network behind the selectivity filter, sidechain conformational dynamics, and water molecules in the gating mechanisms of K+ channels.},

Ensembles of models that best represent the experimental distance distributions are determined by a Monte Carlo search algorithm. As a result, predominantly open conformations are observed in the unliganded state indicating that the majority of enzyme molecules await substrate binding for the catalytic cycle. The addition of a substrate analog yields ensembles with an almost equal mixture of open and closed states. Thus, in the presence of substrate, efficient catalysis is provided by the simultaneous appearance of open conformers (binding substrate or releasing product) and closed conformers (enabling the turnover of the substrate).},

abstract = {There is a general need to develop more powerful and more robust methods for structural characterization of homodimers, homo-oligomers, and multiprotein complexes using solution-state NMR methods. In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on integrating distinct and complementary methodologies for structure determination of multiprotein complexes. One approach not yet widely used is to obtain intermediate and long-range distance constraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based techniques such as double electron electron resonance (DEER), which, when used together, can provide supplemental distance constraints spanning to 10-70 {\AA}. In this Communication, we describe integration of PRE and DEER data with conventional solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for structure determination of Dsy0195, a homodimer (62 amino acids per monomer) from Desulfitobacterium hafniense. Our results indicate that combination of conventional NMR restraints with only one or a few DEER distance constraints and a small number of PRE constraints is sufficient for the automatic NMR-based structure determination program CYANA to build a network of interchain nuclear Overhauser effect constraints that can be used to accurately define both the homodimer interface and the global homodimer structure. The use of DEER distances as a source of supplemental constraints as described here has virtually no upper molecular weight limit, and utilization of the PRE constraints is limited only by the ability to make accurate assignments of the protein amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining distance distributions between pairs of engineered nitroxide spin-labels in proteins and other biological macromolecules. These measurements require the use of cryogenic temperatures (77 K or less) to prolong the phase memory relaxation time (Tm) sufficiently to enable detection of a DEER echo curve. Generally, a cryoprotectant such as glycerol is added to protein samples to facilitate glass formation and avoid protein clustering (which can result in a large decrease in Tm) during relatively slow flash freezing in liquid N2. However, cryoprotectants are osmolytes and can influence protein folding/unfolding equilibria, as well as species populations in weak multimeric systems. Here we show that submillisecond rapid freezing, achieved by high velocity spraying of the sample onto a rapidly spinning, liquid nitrogen cooled copper disc obviates the requirement for cryoprotectants and permits high quality DEER data to be obtained in absence of glycerol. We demonstrate this approach on five different protein systems: protein A, the metastable drkN SH3 domain, urea-unfolded drkN SH3, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the transmembrane domain of HIV-1 gp41 in lipid bicelles.},

Recent structures of family B GPCR-Gs protein complexes reveal a disruption in the $\alpha$-helix of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) not observed in family A GPCRs. To investigate the functional impact of this structural difference, we compared the structure and function of the glucagon receptor (GCGR; family B) with the $\beta$2 adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2AR; family A). We determined the structure of the GCGR-Gs complex by means of cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1-angstrom resolution. This structure shows the distinct break in TM6. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) turnover, guanosine diphosphate release, GTP binding, and G protein dissociation studies revealed much slower rates for G protein activation by the GCGR compared with the $\beta$2AR. Fluorescence and double electron-electron resonance studies suggest that this difference is due to the inability of agonist alone to induce a detectable outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM6.},

This interface is observed concomitantly with the well-known '$\alpha$6:$\alpha$6' interface. We also mapped the contacts between Bak homodimers and the lipid bilayer based on EPR spectroscopy topology studies. Our results suggest a model for the lipidic Bak pore, whereby the mitochondrial targeting C-terminal helix does not change topology to accommodate the lining of the pore lumen by BGH.},

abstract = {Pulsed Electron-electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) is a method frequently used to determine the distances between paramagnetic centers in biomacromolecules on the nanometer scale. A standard algorithm for determination of distances from the experimental data assumes that all possible mutual orientations of the spin labels are equally probable. However, in many applications the mobility of the spin labels attached to large molecules can be significantly restricted. In order to determine the total PELDOR signal in this case, the individual contributions of each rigid biradical should be explicitly calculated for the given frequencies of the probe and pump pulses. The solution of the inverse problem of determination of the ensemble of molecular structures that fit the experimental PELDOR data acquired at multiple microwave frequencies and magnetic fields has proven to be a non-trivial task, especially, when no information about the molecular structure under study is available. In this work we present a fitting algorithm that reconstructs experimental data by searching for an optimal combination of presimulated PELDOR time traces for nitroxide biradicals with all relative orientations and with inter-spin distances in the experimentally accessible range. The generated library of PELDOR time traces has been employed to excellently fit experimental data containing orientation selection effects gathered on model biradical systems. {\textcopyright}the Owner Societies 2013.},

However, a coherent mechanism of Na+-driven transport has not been described. Here, we present two crystal structures of MhsT, an NSS member from Bacillus halodurans, in occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and l-tryptophan, providing insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na2 site. We propose a mechanism, based on our structural and functional findings, in which solvation through the TM5 pathway facilitates Na+ release from Na2 and the transition to an inward-open state.},

abstract = {The biogenic amine transporters (BATs) regulate endogenous neurotransmitter concentrations and are targets for a broad range of therapeutic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin- noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Because eukaryotic BATs are recalcitrant to crystallographic analysis, our understanding of the mechanism of these inhibitors and antidepressants is limited. LeuT is a bacterial homologue of BATs and has proven to be a valuable paradigm for understanding relationships between their structure and function. However, because only approximately 25% of the amino acid sequence of LeuT is in common with that of BATs, and as LeuT is a promiscuous amino acid transporter, it does not recapitulate the pharmacological properties of BATs. Indeed, SSRIs and TCAs bind in the extracellular vestibule of LeuT and act as non-competitive inhibitors of transport. By contrast, multiple studies demonstrate that both TCAs and SSRIs are competitive inhibitors for eukaryotic BATs and bind to the primary binding pocket. Here we engineered LeuT to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by mutating key residues around the primary binding pocket. The final LeuBAT mutant binds the SSRI sertraline with a binding constant of 18 nM and displays high-affinity binding to a range of SSRIs, SNRIs and a TCA. We determined 12 crystal structures of LeuBAT in complex with four classes of antidepressants. The chemically diverse inhibitors have a remarkably similar mode of binding in which they straddle transmembrane helix (TM) 3, wedge between TM3/TM8 and TM1/TM6, and lock the transporter in a sodium-and chloride-bound outward-facing open conformation. Together, these studies define common and simple principles for the action of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs on BATs. {\textcopyright}2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The coupled transport of ions and substrates allows transporters to accumulate substrates using the energy of transmembrane ion gradients and electrical potentials. During transport, conformational changes that switch accessibility of substrate and ion binding sites from one side of the membrane to the other must be controlled so as to prevent uncoupled movement of ions or substrates. In the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family, Na+ stabilizes the transporter in an outward-open state, thus decreasing the likelihood of uncoupled Na+ transport. Substrate binding, in a step essential for coupled transport, must overcome the effect of Na+, allowing intracellular substrate and Na+ release from an inward-open state. However, the specific elements of the protein that mediate this conformational response to substrate binding are unknown. Previously, we showed that in the prokaryotic NSS transporter LeuT, the effect of Na+ on conformation requires the Na2 site, where it influences conformation by fostering interaction between two domains of the protein. Here, we used cysteine accessibility to measure conformational changes of LeuT in Escherichia coli membranes. We identified a conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site required for substrate to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains. We further identify additional required interactions between the two transporter domains in the extracellular pathway. Together with our previous work on the conformational effect of Na+, these results identify mechanistic components underlying ion-substrate coupling in NSS transporters.},

abstract = {Despite advances in sampling and scoring strategies, Monte Carlo modeling methods still struggle to accurately predict de novo the structures of large proteins, membrane proteins, or proteins of complex topologies. Previous approaches have addressed these shortcomings by leveraging sparse distance data gathered using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to improve protein structure prediction and refinement outcomes. However, existing computational implementations entail compromises between coarse-grained models of the spin label that lower the resolution and explicit models that lead to resource-intense simulations. These methods are further limited by their reliance on distance distributions, which are calculated from a primary refocused echo decay signal and contain uncertainties that may require manual refinement. Here, we addressed these challenges by developing RosettaDEER, a scoring method within the Rosetta software suite capable of simulating double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy decay traces and distance distributions between spin labels fast enough to fold proteins de novo. We demonstrate that the accuracy of resulting distance distributions match or exceed those generated by more computationally intensive methods. Moreover, decay traces generated from these distributions recapitulate intermolecular background coupling parameters even when the time window of data collection is truncated. As a result, RosettaDEER can discriminate between poorly folded and native-like models by using decay traces that cannot be accurately converted into distance distributions using regularized fitting approaches. Finally, using two challenging test cases, we demonstrate that RosettaDEER leverages these experimental data for protein fold prediction more effectively than previous methods. These benchmarking results confirm that RosettaDEER can effectively leverage sparse experimental data for a wide array of modeling applications built into the Rosetta software suite.},

abstract = {Interpretation of EPR measurables from spin labels in terms of structure and dynamics requires knowledge of label behavior. General strategies were developed for simulation of labels used in EPR of proteins. The criteria for those simulations are (a) exhaustive sampling of rotamer space, (b) consensus of results independent of starting points, and (c) inclusion of entropy. These criteria are satisfied only when the number of transitions in any dihedral angle exceeds 100 and the simulation maintains thermodynamic equilibrium. Methods such as conventional MD do not efficiently cross energetic barriers, simulated anealing, Monte Carlo or popular Rotamer Library methodologies are potential energy based and ignore entropy (in addition to their specific shortcomings: environment fluctuations, fixed environment, or electrostatics). The Simulated scaling method avoids the above flaws by modulating the force fields between a reduced (allowing crossing energy barriers) and full potential (sampling minima). Spin label diffuses on this surface while remaining in thermodynamic equilibrium. Simulations show that (a) adopting a single conformation is rare, often there are two to four populated rotamers and (b) position of the NO varies up to 16 {\AA}. These results illustrate necessity for caution when interpreting EPR signals in terms of molecular structure. For example, the 10-16 {\AA}distance change in DEER should not be interpreted as a large conformational change, it can well be a flip about C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ bond. Rigorous exploration of possible rotamer structures of a spin label is paramount in signal interpretation. We advocate use of bifunctional labels, motion of which is restricted 10,000-fold and the NO position is restricted to 2-5 {\AA}.},

The rigidity of the fused ring structure and absence of mobile methyl groups increase the spin echo dephasing time (Tm) at temperatures above 80 K. This enables DEER measurements of distances >4 nm in DZD-labeled T4L in glycerol/water at temperatures up to 150 K with increased sensitivity compared to that of a common spin label such as MTSL. Addition of $\beta$-cyclodextrin reduces the rotational correlation time of the label, slightly increases Tm, and most importantly, narrows (and slightly lengthens) the interspin distance distributions. The distance distributions are in good agreement with simulated distance distributions obtained by rotamer libraries. These results provide a foundation for developing supramolecular recognition to facilitate long-distance DEER measurements at near physiological temperatures.},

We illustrate the method for human ubiquitin in solution and find that there is considerable conformational heterogeneity throughout the protein structure. The interior atoms of the protein are tightly packed in each individual conformation that contributes to the ensemble but their overall behaviour can be described as having a significant degree of liquid-like character.

abstract = {On the periplasmic side of LacY, two conserved Gly-Gly pairs in helices II and XI (Gly46 and Gly370, respectively) and helices V and VIII (Gly159 and Gly262, respectively) allow close packing of each helix pair in the outward (periplasmic)-closed conformation. Previous studies demonstrate that replacing one Gly residue in each Gly-Gly pair with Trp leads to opening of the periplasmic cavity with abrogation of transport activity, but an increased rate of galactoside binding. To further investigate the role of the Gly-Gly pairs, 11 double-replacement mutants were constructed for each pair at positions 46 (helix II) and 262 (helix VIII). Replacement with Ala or Ser results in decreased but significant transport activity, while replacements with Thr, Val, Leu, Asn, Gln, Tyr, Trp, Glu, or Lys exhibit very little or no transport. Remarkably, however, the double mutants bind galactoside with affinities 10-20-fold higher than that of the pseudo-WT or WT LacY. Moreover, site-directed alkylation of a periplasmic Cys replacement indicates that the periplasmic cavity becomes readily accessible in the double-replacement mutants. Molecular dynamics simulations with the WT and double-Leu mutant in the inward-open/outward-closed conformation provide support for this interpretation.},

abstract = {HIV type I (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzes the conversion of viral RNA into DNA, initiating the chain of events leading to integration of proviral DNA into the host genome. RT is expressed as a single polypeptide chain within the Gag-Pol polyprotein, and either prior to or following excision by HIV-1 protease forms a 66 kDa chain (p66) homodimer precursor. Further proteolytic attack by HIV-1 protease cleaves the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of a single subunit to yield the mature p66/p51 heterodimer. Here, we probe the spatial domain organization within the p66 homodimer using pulsed Q-band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy to measure a large number of intra- and intersubunit distances between spin labels attached to surface-engineered cysteines. The DEER-derived distances are fully consistent with the structural subunit asymmetry found in the mature p66/p51 heterodimer in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, while the p51 subunit purely serves as a structural scaffold. Furthermore, the p66 homodimer precursor undergoes a conformational change involving the thumb, palm, and finger domains in one of the subunits (corresponding to the p66 subunit in the mature p66/p51 heterodimer) from a closed to a partially open state upon addition of a nonnucleoside inhibitor. The relative orientation of the domains was modeled by simulated annealing driven by the DEER-derived distances. Finally, the RNase H domain that is cleaved to generate p51 in the mature p66/p51 heterodimer is present in 2 major conformers. One conformer is fully solvent accessible thereby accounting for the observation that only a single subunit of the p66 homodimer precursor is susceptible to HIV-1 protease.},

abstract = {We present an approach for calculating conformational changes in membrane proteins using limited distance information. The method, named restraint-driven Cartesian transformations, involves 1) the use of relative distance changes; 2) the systematic sampling of rigid body movements in Cartesian space; 3) a penalty evaluation; and 4) model refinement using energy minimization. As a test case, we have analyzed the structural basis of activation gating in the Streptomyces lividans potassium channel (KcsA). A total of 10 pairs of distance restraints derived from site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) spectra were used to calculate the open conformation of the second transmembrane domains of KcsA (TM2). The SDSL-EPR based structure reveals a gating mechanism consistent with a scissoring-type motion of the TM2 segments that includes a pivot point near middle of the helix. The present approach considerably reduces the amount of time and effort required to establish the overall nature of conformational changes in membrane proteins. It is expected that this approach can be implemented into restrained molecular dynamics protocol to calculate the structure and conformational changes in a variety of membrane protein systems.},

The interpretation of the distance $\Delta$(Pi, Pj) between the ith and jth members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both Q and R techniques. When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinrates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as D2 with a singular dispersion matrix.},

abstract = {Motivation: Loops are often vital for protein function, however, their irregular structures make them difficult to model accurately. Current loop modelling algorithms can mostly be divided into two categories: knowledge-based, where databases of fragments are searched to find suitable conformations and ab initio, where conformations are generated computationally. Existing knowledge-based methods only use fragments that are the same length as the target, even though loops of slightly different lengths may adopt similar conformations. Here, we present a novel method, Sphinx, which combines ab initio techniques with the potential extra structural information contained within loops of a different length to improve structure prediction. Results: We show that Sphinx is able to generate high-accuracy predictions and decoy sets enriched with near-native loop conformations, performing better than the ab initio algorithm on which it is based. In addition, it is able to provide predictions for every target, unlike some knowledge-based methods. Sphinx can be used successfully for the difficult problem of antibody H3 prediction, outperforming RosettaAntibody, one of the leading H3-specific ab initio methods, both in accuracy and speed.},

abstract = {Bilayer lipids contribute to the stability of membrane transporters and are crucially involved in their proper functioning. However, the molecular knowledge of how surrounding lipids affect membrane transport is surprisingly limited and despite its general importance is rarely considered in the molecular description of a transport mechanism. One reason is that only few atomic resolution structures of channels or transporters reveal a functional interaction with lipids, which are difficult to detect in X-ray structures per se. Overcoming these difficulties, we report here on a new structure of the osmotic stress-regulated betaine transporter BetP in complex with anionic lipids. This lipid-associated BetP structure is important in the molecular understanding of osmoregulation due to the strong dependence of activity regulation in BetP on the presence of negatively charged lipids. We detected eight resolved palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) lipids mimicking parts of the membrane leaflets and interacting with key residues in transport and regulation. The lipid-protein interactions observed here in structural detail in BetP provide molecular insights into the role of lipids in osmoregulated secondary transport. {\textcopyright}2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {A major transformation of the amount of biological information can be effected, which can be obtained from a set of experiments by direct incorporation of scientific constraints into the analysis of the data. The chapter has provided a âcookbookâ approach to develop (and using) nonlinear least-squares analysis programs. The term âscientific constraintsâ is meant to denote direct application (into the analysis program) of the mathematical constraints imposed on the data through experimental design and accessory information. When first approaching a data analysis problem, what general class of computer algorithms should be applied to the data needs to be determined. The relationship between experimental observables and biological information in almost all of biochemistry and biophysics is nonlinear. Therefore, the best methodology to fit a nonlinear model to experimental data needs to be determined. The role of the classic biochemical data transformations should be exclusively for graphical representation of the data. All of the data analysis should be performed in a nonlinear fashion on the actual (raw) data. The nonlinear data analysis requirements of different laboratories in the field of biochemistry and biophysics vary greatly. For the laboratory, which occasionally needs to fit small numbers of data (say 10â500 data points) to a model, data can be easily described analytically (for example, sums of exponentials, simple binding isotherms); prepackaged nonlinear data analysis programs will probably be sufficient. {\textcopyright}1992, Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We address the critically important ionization properties of histidine side chains of membrane proteins, when exposed directly to lipid acyl chains within lipid bilayer membranes. The problem is important for addressing general principles that may underlie membrane protein function. To this end, we have employed a favorable host peptide framework provided by GWALP23 (acetyl-GGALW5LALALALALALALW19LAGA-amide). We inserted His residues into position 12 or 14 of GWALP23 (replacing either Leu12or Leu14) and incorporated specific [2H]Ala labels within the helical core sequence. Solidstate 2H NMR spectra report the folding and orientation of the core sequence, revealing marked differences in the histidinecontaining transmembrane helix behavior between acidic and neutral pH conditions. At neutral pH, the GWALP23-H12 and GWALP23-H14 helices exhibit well defined tilted transmembrane orientations in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) bilayer membranes. Under acidic conditions, when His12is protonated and charged, the GWALP23-H12 helix exhibits a major population that moves to the DOPC bilayer surface and a minor population that occupies multiple transmembrane states. The response to protonation of His14 is an increase in helix tilt, but GWALP23-H14 remains in a transmembrane orientation. The results suggest pKavalues of less than 3 for His12 and about 3-5 for His14in DOPC membranes. In the thinner DLPC bilayers, with increased water access, the helices are less responsivetochanges in pH. The combined results enable us to compare the ionization properties of lipid-exposed His, Lys, and Arg side chains in lipid bilayer membranes.},

abstract = {A new software suite, called Crystallography & NMR System (CNS), has been developed for macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography or solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In contrast to existing structure-determination programs the architecture of CNS is highly flexible, allowing for extension to other structure-determination methods, such as electron microscopy and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. CNS has a hierarchical structure: a high-level hypertext markup language (HTML) user interface, task-oriented user input files, module files, a symbolic structure-determination language (CNS language), and low-level source code. Each layer is accessible to the user. The novice user may just use the HTML interface, while the more advanced user may use any of the other layers. The source code will be distributed, thus source-code modification is possible. The CNS language is sufficiently powerful and flexible that many new algorithms can be easily implemented in the CNS language without changes to the source code. The CNS language allows the user to perform operations on data structures, such as structure factors, electron-density maps, and atomic properties. The power of the CNS language has been demonstrated by the implementation of a comprehensive set of crystallographic procedures for phasing, density modification and refinement.

abstract = {The relationship between DNA sequence recognition and catalytic specificity in a DNA-modifying enzyme was explored using paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions as probes for ESR spectroscopic and biochemical studies. Electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy establishes that Cu 2+ coordinates to histidine residues in the EcoRI endonuclease homodimer bound to its specific DNA recognition site. The coordinated His residues were identified by a unique use of Cu 2+-ion based long-range distance constraints. Double electron- electron resonance data yield Cu 2+-Cu 2+ and Cu 2+-nitroxide distances that are uniquely consistent with one Cu 2+ bound to His114 in each subunit. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirms that two Cu 2+ ions bind per complex. Unexpectedly, Mg 2+-catalyzed DNA cleavage by EcoRI is profoundly inhibited by Cu 2+ binding at these hitherto unknown sites, 13 {\AA}away from the Mg 2+positions in the catalytic centers. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a model for inhibition of catalysis, whereby the Cu 2+ ions alter critical protein-DNA interactions and water molecule positions in the catalytic sites. In the absence of Cu 2+, the Mg 2+-dependence of EcoRI catalysis shows positive cooperativity, which would enhance EcoRI inactivation of foreign DNA by irreparable doublestrand cuts, in preference to readily repaired single-strand nicks. Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations suggest that this cooperativity arises because the binding of Mg 2+ in one catalytic site makes the surface electrostatic potential in the distal catalytic site more negative, thus enhancing binding of the second Mg 2+. Taken together, our results shed light on the structural and electrostatic factors that affect site-specific catalysis by this class of endonucleases.},

Here we describe atomistic molecular simulations that demonstrate that both Ras and Rho superfamily members harbor an intrinsic susceptibility to sample multiple conformational states in the absence of nucleotide ligand. By comparing the distribution of conformers in the presence and absence of nucleotide, we show that conformational selection is the dominant mechanism by which Ras and Rho undergo nucleotide-dependent conformational changes.

abstract = {The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 {\AA}for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 {\AA}for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 {\AA}for 11 residue loops. Median RMSDs are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average RMSDs to the native structures improve to 0.43 {\AA}for 5 residue loops, 0.84 {\AA}for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 {\AA}for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol. {\textcopyright}2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here, we introduce a highly constrained nitroxide side chain designated RX as an alternative to R1 for these applications. RX is formed by a facile cross-linking reaction of a bifunctional methanethiosulfonate reagent with pairs of cysteine residues at i and i + 3 or i and i + 4 in an $\alpha$-helix, at i and i + 2 in a $\beta$-strand, or with cysteine residues in adjacent strands in a $\beta$-sheet. Analysis of EPR spectra, a crystal structure of RX in T4 lysozyme, and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) spectroscopy on an immobilized protein containing RX all reveal a highly constrained internal motion of the side chain. Consistent with the constrained geometry, interspin distance distributions between pairs of RX side chains are narrower than those from analogous R1 pairs. As an important consequence of the constrained internal motion of RX, spectral diffusion detected with ELDOR reveals microsecond internal motions of the protein. Collectively, the data suggest that the RX side chain will be useful for distance mapping by EPR spectroscopy, determining spatial orientation of helical segments in oriented specimens, and measuring structural fluctuations on the microsecond time scale.},

abstract = {Given its ability to measure multicomponent distance distributions between electron-spin probes, Double Electron-Electron Resonance spectroscopy (DEER) has become a leading technique to assess the structural dynamics of biomolecules. However, methodologies to evaluate the statistical error of these distributions are not standard, often hampering a rigorous interpretation of the experimental results. Distance distributions are often determined from the experimental DEER data through a mathematical method known as Tikhonov regularization, but this approach makes rigorous error estimates difficult. Here, we build upon an alternative model-based approach in which the distance probability distribution is represented as a sum of Gaussian components and use propagation of errors to calculate an associated confidence band. Our approach considers all sources of uncertainty, including the experimental noise, the uncertainty in the fitted background signal, and the limited time-span of the data collection. The resulting confidence band reveals the most and least reliable features of the probability distribution, thereby informing the structural interpretation of DEER experiments. To facilitate this interpretation, we also generalize the molecular-simulation method known as Ensemble-Biased Metadynamics. This method, originally designed to generate maximum-entropy structural ensembles consistent with one or more probability distributions, now also accounts for the uncertainty in those target distributions, exactly as dictated by their confidence bands. After careful benchmarks, we demonstrate the proposed techniques using DEER results from spin-labeled T4 lysozyme.},

abstract = {Abstract. Dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (DEER and other techniques) enables the structural characterization of macromolecular and biological systems by measurement of distance distributions between unpaired electrons on a nanometer scale. The inference of these distributions from the measured signals is challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. Existing analysis tools are scattered over several applications with specialized graphical user interfaces. This renders comparison, reproducibility, and method development difficult. To remedy this situation, we present DeerLab, an open-source software package for analyzing dipolar EPR data that is modular and implements a wide range of methods. We show that DeerLab can perform one-step analysis based on separable non-linear least squares, fit dipolar multi-pathway models to multi-pulse DEER data, run global analysis with non-parametric distributions, and use a bootstrapping approach to fully quantify the uncertainty in the analysis.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER), also known as pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR), is a time-domain electron paramagnetic resonance method that can measure the weak dipole-dipole interactions between unpaired electrons. DEER has been applied to discrete pairs of free radicals in biological macromolecules and to clusters containing small numbers of free radicals in polymers and irradiated materials. The goal of such work is to determine the distance or distribution of distances between radicals, which is an underdetermined problem. That is, the spectrum of dipolar interactions can be readily calculated for any distribution of free radicals, but there are many, quite different distributions of radicals that could produce the same experimental dipolar spectrum. This paper describes two methods that are useful for approximating the distance distributions for the large subset of cases in which the mutual orientations of the free radicals are uncorrelated and the width of the distribution is more than a few percent of its mean. The first method relies on a coordinate transformation and is parameter-free, while the second is based on iterative least-squares with Tikhonov regularization. Both methods are useful in DEER studies of spin-labeled biomolecules containing more than two labels.},

All members of these families are tabulated, their functional properties are reviewed and phylogenetic/sequence analyses define the evolutionary relationships of the proteins to each other. Evidence is presented that the APC superfamily may include two other currently recognized families that exhibit greater degrees of sequence divergence from APC superfamily members than do the proteins of the 10 established families from each other. At least some of the protein members of these two distantly related families exhibit 11 established TMSs. Altogether, the APC superfamily probably includes 12 currently recognized families with members that exhibit exclusive specificity for amino acids and their derivatives but which can possess 10, 11, 12 or 14 TMSs per polypeptide chain.},

abstract = {The factors contributing to the thermal stability of proteins from thermophilic origins are matters of intense debate and investigation. Thermophilic proteins are thought to possess better packed interiors than their mesophilic counterparts, leading to lesser overall flexibility and a corresponding reduction in surface-to-volume ratio. These observations prompted an analysis of B values reported in high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. In this analysis, the following aspects were addressed: (1) frequency distribution of normalized B values (B' factors) over all the proteins and for individual amino acids; (2) amino acid compositions in high B value regions of polypeptide chains; (3) variation in the B values from core to the surface of proteins in terms of their radius of gyration; and (4) degree of dispersion of normalized B values in spheres around the C$\alpha$ atoms. The analysis revealed that (1) Ser and Thr have lesser flexibility in thermophiles than in mesophiles, (2) the proportion of Glu and Lys in high B value regions of thermophiles is higher and that of Ser and Thr is lower and (3) the dispersion of B values within spheres at Ca atoms is similar in mesophiles and thermophiles. These observations reflect plausible differences in the dynamics of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins and suggest amino acid substitutions that are likely to change thermal stability.},

Unfortunately, for hydrophobic lipid-bound or detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, the maximum distance accessible is much lower, because of a strongly reduced coherence time of the electron spins. Here we introduce a pulse sequence, based on a Carr-Purcell decoupling scheme on the observer spin, where each $\pi$-pulse is accompanied by a shaped sech/tanh inversion pulse applied to the second spin, to overcome this limitation. This pump/probe excitation scheme efficiently recouples the dipolar interaction, allowing a substantially longer observation time window to be achieved. This increases the upper limit and accuracy of distances that can be determined in membrane protein complexes. We validated the method on a bis-nitroxide model compound and applied this technique to the trimeric betaine transporter BetP. Interprotomer distances as long as 6 nm could be reliably determined, which is impossible with the existing methods.},

abstract = {Inferring three-dimensional structural information of biomacromolecules such as proteins from limited experimental data is an important and challenging task. Nuclear Overhauser effect measurements based on nucleic magnetic resonance, disulfide linking, and electron paramagnetic resonance labeling studies can all provide useful partial distance constraint characteristic of the conformations of proteins. In this study, we describe a general approach for reconstructing conformations of biomolecules that are consistent with given distance constraints. Such constraints can be in the form of upper bounds and lower bounds of distances between residue pairs, contact maps based on specific contact distance cutoff values, or indirect distance constraints such as experimental $\phi$ -value measurement. Our approach is based on the framework of sequential Monte Carlo method, a chain growth-based method. We have developed a novel growth potential function to guide the generation of conformations that satisfy given distance constraints. This potential function incorporates not only the distance information of current residue during growth but also the distance information of future residues by introducing global distance upper bounds between residue pairs and the placement of reference points. To obtain protein conformations from indirect distance constraints in the form of experimental $\phi$ -values, we first generate properly weighted contact maps satisfying $\phi$ -value constraints, we then generate conformations from these contact maps. We show that our approach can faithfully generate conformations that satisfy the given constraints, which approach the native structures when distance constraints for all residue pairs are given. {\textcopyright}2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Computational protein structure prediction is a long-standing challenge in bioinformatics. In the process of predicting protein 3D structures, it is common that parts of an experimental structure are missing or parts of a predicted structure need to be remodeled. The process of predicting local protein structures of particular regions is called loop modeling. In this paper, five new loop modeling methods based on machine learning techniques, called NearLooper, ConLooper, ResLooper, HyLooper1, and HyLooper2 are proposed. NearLooper is based on the nearest neighbor technique. ConLooper applies deep convolutional neural networks to predict C $\alpha$ atoms distance matrix as an orientation-independent representation of protein structure. ResLooper uses residual neural networks instead of deep convolutional neural networks. HyLooper1 combines the results of NearLooper and ConLooper while HyLooper2 combines NearLooper and ResLooper. Three commonly used benchmarks for loop modeling are used to compare the performance between these methods and existing state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results show promising performance in which our best method improves existing state-of-the-art methods by 28 and 54 percent of average RMSD on two datasets while being comparable on the other one.},

Inhibition of GlyT1 prolongs neurotransmitter signalling, and has long been a key strategy in the development of therapies for a broad range of disorders of the central nervous system, including schizophrenia and cognitive impairments4. Here, using a synthetic single-domain antibody (sybody) and serial synchrotron crystallography, we have determined the structure of GlyT1 in complex with a benzoylpiperazine chemotype inhibitor at 3.4Â {\AA}resolution. We find that the inhibitor locks GlyT1 in an inward-open conformation and binds at the intracellular gate of the release pathway, overlapping with the glycine-release site. The inhibitor is likely to reach GlyT1 from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Our results define the mechanism of inhibition and enable the rational design of new, clinically efficacious GlyT1 inhibitors.},

abstract = {An unrealized goal in structural biology is the determination of structure and conformational change at high resolution for membrane proteins within the cellular environment. Pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) is a well-established technique to follow conformational changes in purified membrane protein complexes. Here we demonstrate the first proof of concept for the use of PELDOR to observe conformational changes in a membrane protein in intact cells. We exploit the fact that outer membrane proteins usually lack reactive cysteines and that paramagnetic spin labels entering the periplasm are selectively reduced to achieve specific labeling of the cobalamin transporter BtuB in Escherichia coli. We characterize conformational changes in the second extracellular loop of BtuB upon ligand binding and compare the PELDOR data with high-resolution crystal structures. Our approach avoids detergent extraction, purification, and reconstitution usually required for these systems. With this approach, structure, function, conformational changes, and molecular interactions of outer membrane proteins can be studied at high resolution in the cellular environment.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

abstract = {We describe the adaptation of the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures. The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between 51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation <4 {\AA}from the native structure. {\textcopyright}2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâprotein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Background: EPR-based distance measurements between spin labels in proteins have become a valuable tool in structural biology. The direct translation of the experimental distances into structural information is however often impaired by the intrinsic flexibility of the spin labelled side chains. Different algorithms exist that predict the approximate conformation of the spin label either by using pre-computed rotamer libraries of the labelled side chain (rotamer approach) or by simply determining its accessible volume (accessible volume approach). Surprisingly, comparisons with many experimental distances have shown that both approaches deliver the same distance prediction accuracy of about 3 {\AA}. Results: Here, instead of comparing predicted and experimental distances, we test the ability of both approaches to predict the actual conformations of spin labels found in a new high-resolution crystal structure of spin labelled azurin (T21R1). Inside the crystal, the label is found in two very different environments which serve as a challenging test for the in silico approaches. Conclusions: Our results illustrate why simple and more sophisticated programs lead to the same prediciton error. Thus, a more precise treatment of the complete environment of the label and also its interactions with the environment will be needed to increase the accuracy of in silico spin labelling algorithms. {\textcopyright}2014 Florin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The adaptor protein ankyrin-R interacts via its membrane binding domain with the cytoplasmic domain of the anion exchange protein (AE1) and via its spectrin binding domain with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton in human erythrocytes. This set of interactions provides a bridge between the lipid bilayer and the membrane skeleton, thereby stabilizing the membrane. Crystal structures for the dimeric cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (cdb3) and for a 12-ankyrin repeat segment (repeats 13-24) from the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R (AnkD34) have been reported. However, structural data on how these proteins assemble to form a stable complex have not been reported. In the current studies, site-directed spin labeling, in combination with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron-electron resonance, has been utilized to map the binding interfaces of the two proteins in the complex and to obtain inter-protein distance constraints. These data have been utilized to construct a family of structural models that are consistent with the full range of experimental data. These models indicate that an extensive area on the peripheral domain of cdb3 binds to ankyrin repeats 18-20 on the top loop surface of AnkD34 primarily through hydrophobic interactions. This is a previously uncharacterized surface for binding of cdb3 to AnkD34. Because a second dimer of cdb3 is known to bind to ankyrin repeats 7-12 of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R, the current models have significant implications regarding the structural nature of a tetrameric form of AE1 that is hypothesized to be involved in binding to full-length ankyrin-R in the erythrocyte membrane. {\textcopyright}2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {The plasmalemmal monoamine transporters clear the extracellular space from their cognate substrates and sustain cellular monoamine stores even during neuronal activity. In some instances, however, the transporters enter a substrate-exchange mode, which results in release of intracellular substrate. Understanding what determines the switch between these two transport modes demands time-resolved measurements of intracellular (co-)substrate binding and release. Here, we report an electrophysiological investigation of intracellular solute-binding to the human serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in HEK-293 cells. We measured currents induced by rapid application of serotonin employing varying intracellular (co-)substrate concentrations and interpreted the data using kinetic modeling. Our measurements revealed that the induction of the substrate-exchange mode depends on both voltage and intracellular Na+ concentrations because intracellular Na+ release occurs before serotonin release and is highly electrogenic. This voltage dependence was blunted by electrogenic binding of intracellular K+ and, notably, also H+. In addition, our data suggest that Cl- is bound to SERT during the entire catalytic cycle. Our experiments, therefore, document an essential role of electrogenic binding of K+ or of H+ to the inward-facing conformation of SERT in (i) cancelling out the electrogenic nature of intracellular Na+ release and (ii) in selecting the forward-transport over the substrate-exchange mode. Finally, the kinetics of intracellular Na+ release and K+ (or H+) binding result in a voltage-independent rate-limiting step where SERT may return to the outward-facing state in a KCl- or HCl-bound form.},

This technique was used both to verify conformations selected from the set of known canonical structures and to explore conformations available at the H3 loop in CEA ab initio. Canonical structures are not available for H3 due to its variability in length, sequence, and observed conformation in known antibody structures Analysis of the results of conformational search resulted in three equally probable conformations for H3 loop in CEA. Force field energies, solvation free energies, exposure of charged residues and burial of hydrophobic residues, and packing of hydrophobic residues at the base of the loop were used as selection criteria.

abstract = {Protein spin labeling to yield the nitroxide-based R1 side chain is a powerful method to measure protein dynamics and structure by electron spin resonance. However, R1 measurements are complicated by the flexibility of the side chain. While analysis approaches for solvent-exposed $\alpha$-helical environment have been developed to partially account for flexibility, similar work in $\beta$-sheets is lacking. The goal of this study is to provide the first essential steps for understanding the conformational preferences of R1 within edge $\beta$-strands using X-ray crystallography and double electron electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements. Crystal structures yielded seven rotamers for a non-hydrogen-bonded site and three rotamers for a hydrogen-bonded site. The observed rotamers indicate contextual differences in R1 conformational preferences compared to other solvent-exposed environments. For the DEER measurements, each strand site was paired with the same $\alpha$-helical site elsewhere on the protein. The most probable distance observed by DEER is rationalized based on the rotamers observed in the crystal structure. Additionally, the appropriateness of common molecular modeling methods that account for R1 conformational preferences are assessed for the $\beta$-sheet environment. These results show that interpretation of R1 behavior in $\beta$-sheets is difficult and indicate further development is needed for these computational methods to correctly relate DEER distances to protein structure at edge $\beta$-strand sites.},

Specifically, we consider the cofactor binding fragment of CysB; the lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein (LAO); the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD); the ribose-binding protein (RBP); the N-terminal lobe of ovotransferrin in apo-form (apo-OVOT); and the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP). All have domains that resemble a Rossmann fold, but there are also some significant differences. Results indicate that similar global dynamic behavior is preserved for the members of a fold family, and that differences usually occur in regions only where specific function is localized. The present work is a computational demonstration that the scaffold of a protein fold may be utilized for diverse purposes. LAO requires a bound ligand before it conforms to the large-scale fluctuation behavior of the three other members of the family, CysB, PBGD, and RBP, all of which contain a substrate (cofactor) at the active site cleft. The dynamics of the ligand-free enzymes LIVBP and apo- OVOT, on the other hand, concur with that of unliganded LAO.

abstract = {Biological ion channels are nanoscale transmembrane pores. When water and ions are enclosed within the narrow confines of a sub-nanometer hydrophobic pore, they exhibit behavior not evident from macroscopic descriptions. At this nanoscopic level, the unfavorable interaction between the lining of a hydrophobic pore and water may lead to stochastic liquid-vapor transitions. These transient vapor states are "dewetted", i.e. effectively devoid of water molecules within all or part of the pore, thus leading to an energetic barrier to ion conduction. This process, termed "hydrophobic gating", was first observed in molecular dynamics simulations of model nanopores, where the principles underlying hydrophobic gating (i.e., changes in diameter, polarity, or transmembrane voltage) have now been extensively validated. Computational, structural, and functional studies now indicate that biological ion channels may also exploit hydrophobic gating to regulate ion flow within their pores. Here we review the evidence for this process and propose that this unusual behavior of water represents an increasingly important element in understanding the relationship between ion channel structure and function.},

The drug-binding site and the mechanism of this inhibition are poorly understood. We determined the crystal structure at 2.9 angstroms of the bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), a homolog of SERT, NET, and DAT, in complex with leucine and the antidepressant desipramine. Desipramine binds at the inner end of the extracellular cavity of the transporter and is held in place by a hairpin loop and by a salt bridge. This binding site is separated from the leucine-binding site by the extracellular gate of the transporter. By directly locking the gate, desipramine prevents conformational changes and blocks substrate transport. Mutagenesis experiments on human SERT and DAT indicate that both the desipramine-binding site and its inhibition mechanism are probably conserved in the human neurotransmitter transporters.},

abstract = {Studies of structure and dynamics of proteins using site-directed spin labelling rely on explicit modelling of spin label conformations. The large computational effort associated with such modelling with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be avoided by a rotamer library approach based on a coarse-grained representation of the conformational space of the spin label. We show here that libraries of about 200 rotamers, obtained by iterative projection of a long MD trajectory of the free spin label onto a set of canonical dihedral angles, provide a representation of the underlying trajectory adequate for EPR distance measurements. Rotamer analysis was performed on selected X-ray structures of spin labelled T4 lysozyme mutants to characterize the spin label rotamer ensemble on a single protein site. Furthermore, predictions based on the rotamer library approach are shown to be in nearly quantitative agreement with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance data on the Na+/H + antiporter NhaA and on the light-harvesting complex LHCII whose structures are known from independent cryo electron microscopy and X-ray studies, respectively. Suggestions for the selection of labelling sites in proteins are given, limitations of the approach discussed, and requirements for further development are outlined. {\textcopyright}the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {A central tenet of biology is that globular proteins have a unique 3D structure under physiological conditions. Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that some proteins switch folds, a process that involves remodeling of secondary structure in response to a few mutations (evolved fold switchers) or cellular stimuli (extant fold switchers). To date, extant fold switchers have been viewed as rare byproducts of evolution, but their frequency has been neither quantified nor estimated. By systematically and exhaustively searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we found â¼100 extant fold-switching proteins. Furthermore, we gathered multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these proteins are widespread in nature. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesized that the frequency of extant fold-switching proteins may be underrepresented by the structures in the PDB. Thus, we sought to identify other putative extant fold switchers with only one solved conformation. To do this, we identified two characteristic features of our â¼100 extant fold-switching proteins, incorrect secondary structure predictions and likely independent folding cooperativity, and searched the PDB for other proteins with similar features. Reassuringly, this method identified dozens of other proteins in the literature with indication of a structural change but only one solved conformation in the PDB. Thus, we used it to estimate that 0.5â4% of PDB proteins switch folds. These results demonstrate that extant fold-switching proteins are likely more common than the PDB reflects, which has implications for cell biology, genomics, and human health.},

We find that variations in the common core and emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to GT-A diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during evolution. Using evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 90% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs. Our studies provide an evolutionary framework for investigating complex relationships connecting GT-A fold sequence, structure, function and regulation.},

abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential element of nearly all Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes and serves to protect the cell from adverse environmental stresses. Seven members of the lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) protein family function together to transport LPS from the inner membrane (IM) to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Each of these proteins has a solved crystal structure, including LptC, which is a largely periplasmic protein that is associated with the IM LptB 2 FG complex and anchored to the membrane by an N-terminal helix. LptC directly binds LPS and is hypothesized to be involved in the transfer of LPS to another periplasmic protein, LptA. Purified and in solution, LptC forms a dimer. Here, point mutations designed to disrupt formation of the dimer are characterized using site-directed spin labeling double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, light scattering, circular dichroism, and computational modeling. The computational studies reveal the molecular interactions that drive dimerization of LptC and elucidate how the disruptive mutations change this interaction, while the DEER and light scattering studies identify which mutants disrupt the dimer. And, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and comparing the results to the previous quantitative characterization of the interactions between dimeric LptC and LPS and LptA, the functional consequences of monomeric LptC were also determined. These results indicate that disruption of the dimer does not affect LPS or LptA binding and that monomeric LptC binds LPS and LptA at levels similar to dimeric LptC.},

The model improves performance in computational benchmarks against experimental targets, including prediction of protein orientations in the bilayer, $\Delta$$\Delta$G calculations, native structure discrimination, and native sequence recovery. When applied to de novo protein design, this approach designs sequences with an amino acid distribution near the native amino acid distribution in membrane proteins, overcoming a critical flaw in previous membrane models that were prone to generating leucine-rich designs. Furthermore, the proteins designed in the new membrane model exhibit native-like features including interfacial aromatic side chains, hydrophobic lengths compatible with bilayer thickness, and polar pores. Our method advances high-resolution membrane protein structure prediction and design toward tackling key biological questions and engineering challenges.},

abstract = {A significant problem with paramagnetic tags attached to proteins and nucleic acids is their conformational mobility. Each tag is statistically distributed within a volume between 5 and 10 Angstroms across; structural biology conclusions from NMR and EPR work are necessarily diluted by this uncertainty. The problem is solved in electron spin resonance, but remains open in the other major branch of paramagnetic resonance-pseudocontact shift (PCS) NMR spectroscopy, where structural biologists have so far been reluctantly using the point paramagnetic centre approximation. Here we describe a new method for extracting probability densities of lanthanide tags from PCS data. The method relies on Tikhonov-regularised 3D reconstruction and opens a new window into biomolecular structure and dynamics because it explores a very different range of conditions from those accessible to double electron resonance work on paramagnetic tags: a room-temperature solution rather than a glass at cryogenic temperatures. The method is illustrated using four different Tm3+ DOTA-M8 tagged mutants of human carbonic anhydrase II; the results are in good agreement with rotamer library and DEER data. The wealth of high-quality pseudocontact shift data accumulated by the biological magnetic resonance community over the last 30 years, and so far only processed using point models, could now become a major source of useful information on conformational distributions of paramagnetic tags in biomolecules.},

This system provided experimental DEER data between two Cu(ii) ions with a well-defined distance and relative orientation to assess the accuracy of the methodology. Evaluation of orientation-selective DEER (os DEER) on systems with limited flexibility was probed using a series of porphyrin-based Cu(ii)-nitroxide and Cu(ii)-Cu(ii) model systems of well-defined lengths synthesized for this project. Density functional theory was employed to generate molecular models of the conformers for each porphyrin-based Cu(ii) dimer studied. Excellent agreement was found between DEER traces simulated using these computed conformers and the experimental data. The performance of different parameterised structural models in simulating the experimental DEER data was also investigated. The results of this analysis demonstrate the degree to which the DEER data define the relative orientation of the two Cu(ii) ions and highlight the need to choose a parameterised model that captures the essential features of the flexibility (rotational freedom) of the system being studied.},

abstract = {Recoverin, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) branch of the calmodulin superfamily, is expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells and serves as a calcium sensor in vision. Ca2+-induced conformational changes in recoverin cause extrusion of its covalently attached myristate (termed Ca 2+-myristoyl switch) that promotes translocation of recoverin to disk membranes during phototransduction in retinal rod cells. Here we report double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments on recoverin that probe Ca 2+-induced changes in distance as measured by the dipolar coupling between spin-labels strategically positioned at engineered cysteine residues on the protein surface. The DEER distance between nitroxide spin-labels attached at C39 and N120C is 2.5 Â± 0.1 nm for Ca2+-free recoverin and 3.7 Â± 0.1 nm for Ca2+-bound recoverin. An additional DEER distance (5-6 nm) observed for Ca2+-bound recoverin may represent an intermolecular distance between C39 and N120. 15N NMR relaxation analysis and CW-EPR experiments both confirm that Ca2+-bound recoverin forms a dimer at protein concentrations above 100 $\mu$M, whereas Ca2+-free recoverin is monomeric. We propose that Ca 2+-induced dimerization of recoverin at the disk membrane surface may play a role in regulating Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of dimeric rhodopsin. The DEER approach will be useful for elucidating dimeric structures of NCS proteins in general for which Ca2+-induced dimerization is functionally important but not well understood. {\textcopyright}2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction, there has been relatively little connection between experimental protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) of the native structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction. Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high CO structures and an excess of low CO structures, as expected if the computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process. Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction in the CASP4 (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment involved high CO structures likely to fold much more slowly than the lower CO structures for which reasonable predictions were made. This bias against high CO structures can be partially alleviated by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting out the higher CO structures, and eliminating the very low CO structures; this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies may be possible following significant increases in high-performance computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high CO conformations (high CO proteins can take six orders of magnitude longer to fold than low CO proteins). Importantly for such a strategy, simulations performed for high CO structures converge much less strongly than those for low CO structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence can indicate the need for improved sampling of high CO conformations. The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may extend to misfolding: The very low CO structures that accumulate in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.},

abstract = {Biological supramolecular systems are commonly built up by the self-assembly of identical protein subunits to produce symmetrical oligomers with cyclical, icosahedral, or helical symmetry that play roles in processes ranging from allosteric control and molecular transport to motor action. The large size of these systems often makes them difficult to structurally characterize using experimental techniques. We have developed a computational protocol to predict the structure of symmetrical protein assemblies based on the structure of a single subunit. The method carries out simultaneous optimization of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom, while restricting the search space to symmetrical conformations. Using this protocol, we can reconstruct, starting from the structure of a single subunit, the structure of cyclic oligomers and the icosahedral virus capsid of satellite panicum virus using a rigid backbone approximation. We predict the oligomeric state of EscJ from the type III secretion system both in its proposed cyclical and crystallized helical form. Finally, we show that the method can recapitulate the structure of an amyloid-like fibril formed by the peptide NNQQNY from the yeast prion protein Sup35 starting from the amino acid sequence alone and searching the complete space of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom. {\textcopyright}2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Metallochaperones are responsible for shuttling metal ions to target proteins. Thus, a metallochaperone's structure must be sufficiently flexible both to hold onto its ion while traversing the cytoplasm and to transfer the ion to or from a partner protein. Here, we sought to shed light on the structure of Atox1, a metallochaperone involved in the human copper regulation system. Atox1 shuttles copper ions from the main copper transporter, Ctr1, to the ATP7b transporter in the Golgi apparatus. Conventional biophysical tools such as X-ray or NMR cannot always target the various conformational states of metallochaperones, owing to a requirement for crystallography or low sensitivity and resolution. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has recently emerged as a powerful tool for resolving biological reactions and mechanisms in solution. When coupled with computational methods, EPR with site-directed spin labeling and nanoscale distance measurements can provide structural information on a protein or protein complex in solution. We use these methods to show that Atox1 can accommodate at least four different conformations in the apo state (unbound to copper), and two different conformations in the holo state (bound to copper). We also demonstrate that the structure of Atox1 in the holo form is more compact than in the apo form. Our data provide insight regarding the structural mechanisms through which Atox1 can fulfill its dual role of copper binding and transfer.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size e and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter e on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers. {\textcopyright}2014 Matthew D.

The average root mean square deviation ranged from 0.78 A for three residue loops to 3.5 A for eight residue loops on a nonhomologous test set. CODA clusters the predictions from the two independent programs and makes a consensus prediction that must pass a set of rule-based filters. CODA was parameterized and tested on two unrelated separate sets of structures that were nonhomologous to one another and those found in the FREAD database. The average root mean square deviation in the test set ranged from 0.76 A for three residue loops to 3.09 A for eight residue loops. CODA shows a general improvement in loop prediction over PETRA and FREAD individually. The improvement is far more marked for lengths six and upward, probably as the predictive power of PETRA becomes more important.

abstract = {Many proteins consist of folded domains connected by regions with higher flexibility. The details of the resulting conformational ensemble play a central role in controlling interactions between domains and with binding partners. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is well-suited to study the conformational states adopted by proteins in solution. However, analysis is complicated by the limited information content in SAS data and care must be taken to avoid constructing overly complex ensemble models and fitting to noise in the experimental data. To address these challenges, we developed a method based on Bayesian statistics that infers conformational ensembles from a structural library generated by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. The first stage of the method involves a fast model selection based on variational Bayesian inference that maximizes the model evidence of the selected ensemble. This is followed by a complete Bayesian inference of population weights in the selected ensemble. Experiments with simulated ensembles demonstrate that model evidence is capable of identifying the correct ensemble and that correct number of ensemble members can be recovered up to high level of noise. Using experimental data, we demonstrate how the method can be extended to include data from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and structural energies of conformers extracted from the all-atom energy functions. We show that the data from SAXS, NMR chemical shifts and energies calculated from conformers can work synergistically to improve the definition of the conformational ensemble.},

The denatured ensemble populated under these conditions comprises conformations that are compact. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate a small increase in Stokes radius over that of the native state. A significant degree of alpha-helical structure in these conformations is detected by far-UV circular dichroism, and some tertiary interactions are suggested by near-UV circular dichroism. The characteristics of the denatured state populated by methionine oxidation in nondenaturing buffer are very different from those found in chemical denaturant.},

The light chain constitutes the transport subunit whereas the heavy chain mediates trafficking to the plasma membrane and maturation of the functional complex. Mutation, malfunction, and dysregulation of HATs are associated with a wide range of pathologies or represent the direct cause of inherited and acquired disorders. Here we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the neutral and basic amino acid transport complex (b[0,+]AT1-rBAT) which reveals a heterotetrameric protein assembly composed of two heavy and light chain subunits, respectively. The previously uncharacterized interaction between two HAT units is mediated via dimerization of the heavy chain subunits and does not include participation of the light chain subunits. The b(0,+)AT1 transporter adopts a LeuT fold and is captured in an inward-facing conformation.

In recent microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations of a complete model of the dopamine transporter, a NSS protein, we observed a partitioning of K+ ions from the intracellular side toward the unoccupied Na2 site of dopamine transporter following the release of the Na2-bound Na+ . Here we evaluate with computational simulations and experimental measurements of ion affinities under corresponding conditions, the consequences of K+ binding in the Na2 site of LeuT, a bacterial homolog of NSS, when both Na+ ions and substrate have left, and the transporter prepares for a new cycle. We compare the results with the consequences of binding Na+ in the same apo system. Analysis of >50-$\mu$s atomistic molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling trajectories of constructs with Glu290 , either charged or neutral, point to the Glu290 protonation state as a main determinant in the structural reconfiguration of the extracellular vestibule of LeuT in which a "water gate" opens through coordinated motions of residues Leu25 , Tyr108 , and Phe253 . The resulting water channel enables the binding/dissociation of the Na+ and K+ ions that are prevalent, respectively, in the extracellular and intracellular environments.},

However, identifying the molecular interactions that underlie the pharmacological activity of these transport inhibitors, and thus the mechanism by which the inhibitors lead to increased synaptic neurotransmitter levels, has proven elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter at 3.0 {\AA}resolution bound to the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline. The transporter is locked in an outward-open conformation with nortriptyline wedged between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6 and 8, blocking the transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing conformation. Although the overall structure of the dopamine transporter is similar to that of its prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix 12 halfway across the membrane bilayer, a latch-like carboxy-terminal helix that caps the cytoplasmic gate, and a cholesterol molecule wedged within a groove formed by transmembrane helices 1a, 5 and 7. Taken together, the dopamine transporter structure reveals the molecular basis for antidepressant action on sodium-coupled neurotransmitter symporters and elucidates critical elements of eukaryotic transporter structure and modulation by lipids, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanism and regulation of neurotransmitter uptake at chemical synapses. {\textcopyright}2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution. {\textcopyright}2009 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {The natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family encompasses transition metal and proton cotransporters that are present in many organisms from bacteria to humans. Recent structures of Deinococcus radiodurans Nramp (DraNramp) in multiple conformations revealed the intramolecular rearrangements required for alternating access of the metalbinding site to the external or cytosolic environment. Here, using recombinant proteins and metal transport and cysteine accessibility assays, we demonstrate that two parallel cytoplasm- accessible networks of conserved hydrophilic residues in DraNramp, one lining the wide intracellular vestibule for metal release and the other forming a narrow proton transport pathway, are essential for metal transport. We further show that mutagenic or posttranslational modifications of transmembrane helix (TM) 6b, which structurally links these two pathways, impede normal conformational cycling and metal transport. TM6bcontains two highly conserved histidines, His232 and His237. We found that different mutagenic perturbations of His232, just below the metal-binding site along the proton exit route, differentially affect DraNramp's conformational state, suggesting that His232 serves as a pivot point for conformational changes. In contrast, any replacement of His237, lining the metal exit route, locked the transporter in a transport-inactive outward- closed state. We conclude that these two histidines, and TM6b more broadly, help trigger the bulk rearrangement of DraNramp to the inward-open state upon metal binding and facilitate return of the empty transporter to an outward-open state upon metal release.},

abstract = {We present a fast ab initio method for the prediction of local conformations in proteins. The program, PETRA, selects polypeptide fragments from a computer-generated database (APD) encoding all possible peptide fragments up to twelve amino acids long. Each fragment is defined by a representative set of eight $\phi$/$\psi$ pairs, obtained iteratively from a trial set by calculating how fragments generated from them represent the protein databank (PDB). Ninety-six percent (96%) of length five fragments in crystal structures, with a resolution better than 1.5 {\AA}and less than 25% identity, have a conformer in the database with less than 1 k root-mean-square deviation (rmsd). In order to select segments from APD, PETRA uses a set of simple rule-based filters, thus reducing the number of potential conformations to a manageable total. This reduced set is scored and sorted using rmsd fit to the anchor regions and a knowledge-based energy function dependent on the sequence to be modelled. The best scoring fragments can then be optimized by minimization of contact potentials and rmsd fit to the core model. The quality of the prediction made by PETRA is evaluated by calculating both the differences in rmsd and backbone torsion angles between the final model and the native fragment. The average rmsd ranges from 1.4 k for three residue loops to 3.9 {\AA}for eight residue loops. (C) 2000 Wiley- Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Loops are the most variable regions of protein structure and are, in general, the least accurately predicted. Their prediction has been approached in two ways, ab initio and database search. In recent years, it has been thought that ab initio methods are more powerful. In light of the continued rapid expansion in the number of known protein structures, we have re-evaluated FREAD, a database search method and demonstrate that the power of database search methods may have been underestimated. We found that sequence similarity as quantified by environment specific substitution scores can be used to significantly improve prediction. In fact, FREAD performs appreciably better for an identifiable subset of loops (two thirds of shorter loops and half of the longer loops tested) than the ab initio methods of MODELLER, PLOP, and RAPPER. Within this subset, FREAD's predictive ability is length independent, in general, producing results within 2A RMSD, compared to an average of over 10{\AA}for loop length 20 for any of the other tested methods. We also benchmarked the prediction protocols on a set of 212 loops from the model structures in CASP 7 and 8. An extended version of FREAD is able to make predictions for 127 of these, it gives the best prediction of the methods tested in 61 of these cases. In examining FREAD's ability to predict in the model environment, we found that whole structure quality did not affect the quality of loop predictions. {\textcopyright}2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) has emerged as a powerful technique for measuring long range distances and distance distributions between paramagnetic centers in biomolecules. This information can then be used to characterize functionally relevant structural and dynamic properties of biological molecules and their macromolecular assemblies. Approaches have been developed for analyzing experimental data from standard four-pulse DEER experiments to extract distance distributions. However, these methods typically use an a priori baseline correction to account for background signals. In the current work an approach is described for direct fitting of the DEER signal using a model for the distance distribution which permits a rigorous error analysis of the fitting parameters. Moreover, this approach does not require a priori background correction of the experimental data and can take into account excluded volume effects on the background signal when necessary. The global analysis of multiple DEER data sets is also demonstrated. Global analysis has the potential to provide new capabilities for extracting distance distributions and additional structural parameters in a wide range of studies. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In site directed spin labeling, a nitroxide side chain is introduced at a selected site in a protein; the most commonly used is a disulfide-linked side chain designated R1. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of R1, and the interspin distance between pairs of R1 residues as determined by dipolar EPR spectroscopy, encode a wealth of information on the protein structure and dynamics. However, extracting this information requires structural and dynamical models of the R1 side chain, that is, the favored rotamers, the intraresidue interactions that stabilize them, and the internal modes of motion. X-ray crystal structures of R1 in proteins have revealed a set of preferred rotamers in the crystal lattice. To identify the intraresidue interactions that stabilize particular rotamers of R1 in the absence of interactions with nearby side chains in a helix, and to evaluate models for the internal motion of the side chain, quantum mechanical calculations were performed on a relevant fragment of R1 in a 10-residue $\alpha$-helix. Relative rotamer energies were determined in the gas phase, and solvation energies were estimated from a continuum solvent model that includes both electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions. The results identified preferred rotamers that are in agreement with the X-ray crystallographic studies. The rotamers are apparently stabilized by intraresidue sulfur-backbone interactions, suggesting that the preferred rotamers may be the same at all solvent-exposed helix sites. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

The performance of the new spin label was demonstrated in W-band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements on doubly trityl-labelled mutants of immunoglobulin G-binding protein 1 (GB1) and ubiquitin. For both doubly CT02MA-labelled proteins we measured, by applying chirped pump pulse(s), relatively narrow distance distributions, comparable to those obtained with the same protein mutants doubly labelled with BrPy-DO3MA-Gd(iii). We noticed, however, that the sample contained some free CT02MA that was difficult to remove at the purification step. Dual labelling of ubiquitin with one CT02MA tag and one BrPy-DO3MA-Gd(iii) tag was achieved as well and the trityl-Gd(iii) distance distribution was measured, facilitated by the use of a dual mode cavity in combination with a chirped pump pulse. We also measured the Gd(iii)-Gd(iii) distance distribution in this sample, showing that the labelling procedure was not fully selective. Nevertheless, these measurements demonstrate the potential of the high sensitivity Gd(iii)-trityl W-band DEER distance measurements in proteins, which can be further exploited by designing orthogonal Gd(iii)/trityl labelling schemes.},

YddG is a bacterial DMT protein that expels aromatic amino acids and exogenous toxic compounds, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis. Here we present structural and functional analyses of YddG. Using liposome-based analyses, we show that Escherichia coli and Starkeya novella YddG export various amino acids. The crystal structure of S. novella YddG at 2.4 {\AA}resolution reveals a new membrane transporter topology, with ten transmembrane segments in an outward-facing state. The overall structure is basket-shaped, with a large substrate-binding cavity at the centre of the molecule, and is composed of inverted structural repeats related by two-fold pseudo-symmetry. On the basis of this intramolecular symmetry, we propose a structural model for the inward-facing state and a mechanism of the conformational change for substrate transport, which we confirmed by biochemical analyses. These findings provide a structural basis for the mechanism of transport of DMT superfamily proteins.},

The stoichiometry of transported 5-HT and ions is predicted to result in electroneutral charge movement. However, hSERT mediates a current when challenged with 5-HT. This discrepancy can be accounted for by an uncoupled ion flux. Here, we investigated the mechanistic basis of the uncoupled currents and its relation to the conformational cycle of hSERT. Our observations support the conclusion that the conducting state underlying the uncoupled ion flux is in equilibrium with an inward facing state of the transporter with K + bound. We identified conditions associated with accumulation of the transporter in inward facing conformations. Manipulations that increased the abundance of inward facing states resulted in enhanced steady-state currents. We present a comprehensive kinetic model of the transport cycle, which recapitulates salient features of the recorded currents.

Common features in their approaches include a dependence on physics-based force fields to judge alternative conformations and the use of molecular dynamics to relax models to local minima, usually with some restraints to prevent excessively large movements.

abstract = {Bacterial pathogens are a major cause of foodborne diseases and food poisoning. To cope with the acid conditions encountered in different environments such as in fermented food or in the gastric compartment, neutralophilic bacteria have developed several adaptive mechanisms. One of those mechanisms, the amino acid dependent system, consumes intracellular protons in biochemical reactions. It involves an antiporter that facilitates the exchange of external substrate amino acid for internal product and a cytoplasmic decarboxylase that catalyzes a proton-consuming decarboxylation of the substrate. So far, four acid resistance antiporters have been discovered, namely the glutamate-$\gamma$-aminobutyric acid antiporter GadC, the arginine-agmatine antiporter AdiC, the lysine-cadaverine antiporter CadB, and the ornithine-putrescine antiporter PotE. The 3D structures of AdiC and GadC, reveal an inverted-repeat fold of two times 5 transmembrane helices, typical of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily of transporters. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the transport mechanism, the pH regulation and the selectivity of these four acid resistance antiporters. It also highlights that AdiC is a paradigm for eukaryotic amino acid transporters of the APC superfamily as structural models of several of these transporters built using AdiC structures were exploited to unveil their mechanisms of amino acid recognition and translocation.},

In the 13th Critial Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP13), we sought to carry out a thorough search for low energy states in the neighborhood of a starting model using restraints to avoid straying too far. The approach was reasonably successful in improving both regions largely incorrect in the starting models as well as core regions that started out closer to the correct structure. Models with GDT-HA over 70 were obtained for five targets and for one of those, an accuracy of 0.5 {\aa} backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was achieved. An important current challenge is to improve performance in refining oligomers and larger proteins, for which the search problem remains extremely difficult.},

This work attempts to address this problem with a novel combination of site-directed spin labelling electron spin resonance spectroscopy (SDSL-ESR) and protein structure modelling, which is coupled by restriction of the conformational spaces of the amino acid side chains.

In particular, the partial excitation artefact is hard to eliminate experimentally at frequencies where DEER is most sensitive or on spectrometers that provide only monochromatic pulses. Here, a data post-processing method is introduced that removes the partial excitation artefact without relying on previous knowledge of its amplitude and without sensitivity loss. The method is based on acquisition of two traces with shifted positions of the artefact and computation of the artefact shape from the difference of the two traces. Artefact removal was successfully tested both on simulated and experimental data. It was found to be stable for a variety of distance distributions and down to low signal-to-noise ratios in the presence of moderate background decay. The artefact correction method also performs well in the regime of rather strong partial excitation artefacts that is usually encountered with rectangular monochromatic pump pulses on widely available commercial spectrometers.},

A strong propensity toward symmetric architectures has long been recognized for water-soluble proteins, and this propensity has been rationalized from an evolutionary standpoint. Proteins residing in cellular membranes, however, have traditionally been less amenable to structural studies, and thus the prevalence and significance of symmetry in this important class of molecules is not as well understood. In the past two decades, researchers have made great strides in this area, and these advances have provided exciting insights into the range of architectures adopted by membrane proteins. These structural studies have revealed a similarly strong bias toward symmetric arrangements, which were often unexpected and which occurred despite the restrictions imposed by the membrane environment on the possible symmetry groups. Moreover, membrane proteins disproportionately contain internal structural repeats resulting from duplication and fusion of smaller segments. This article discusses the types and origins of symmetry in membrane proteins and the implications of symmetry for protein function.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyl-transferase (CobU) from Salmonella typhimurium has been determined to 2.3 {\AA}resolution. This enzyme of subunit molecular weight 19 770 plays a central role in the assembly of the nucleotide loop for adenosylcobalamin where it catalyzes both the phosphorylation of the 1- amino-2-propanol side chain of the corrin ring and the subsequent attachment of GMP to form the product adenosylcobinamide-GDP. The kinase activity is believed to be associated with a P-loop motif, whereas the transferase activity proceeds at a different site on the enzyme via a guanylyl intermediate. The enzyme was crystallized in the space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 96.4 {\AA}, b = 114.4 {\AA}, and c = 106.7 {\AA}, with three subunits per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the enzyme is a molecular trimer and appears somewhat like a propeller with overall molecular dimensions of approximately 64 {\AA}x 77 {\AA}, x 131 {\AA}. Each subunit consists of a single domain that is dominated by a seven-stranded mixed $\beta$-sheet flanked on either side by a total of five $\alpha$-helices and one helical turn. Six of the seven $\beta$-strands run parallel. The C-terminal strand lies at the edge of the sheet and runs antiparallel to the others. Interestingly, CobU displays a remarkable structural and topological similarity to the central domain of the RecA protein, although the reason for this observation is unclear. The structure contains a P-loop motif located at the base of a prominent cleft formed by the association of two subunits and is most likely the kinase active site. Each subunit of CobU contains a cis peptide bond between Glu80 and Cys80 where Glu80 faces the P-loop and might serve to coordinate the magnesium ion of the triphosphate substrate. Interestingly, His46, which is the putative site for guanylylation, lies $\sim$21 {\AA}from the P-loop and is solvent-exposed. This suggests that the enzyme undergoes a conformational change when the substrates bind to bring these two active sites into closer proximity.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP) from Escherichia coli in a ligand-free 'open' conformational state has been determined by isomorphous replacement methods and refined to an R-value of 21.4% at 2.3 {\AA}resolution. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by pseudo 4-fold screw symmetry. The refined model consists of 3587 non-hydrogen atoms from 440 residues (two monomers), and 159 water molecules. The structure has root-mean-square deviations of 0.013 {\AA}from 'ideal' bond lengths and 1.5Â° from 'ideal' bond angles. The GlnBP molecule has overall dimensions of approximately 60 {\AA}x 40 {\AA}x 35 {\AA}and is made up of two domains (termed large and small), which exhibit a similar supersecondary structure, linked by two antiparallel $\beta$-strands. The small domain contains three $\alpha$-helices and four parallel and one antiparallel $\beta$-strands. The large domain is similar to the small domain but contains two additional $\alpha$-helices and three more short antiparallel $\beta$-strands. A comparison of the secondary structural motifs of GlnBP with those of other periplasmic binding proteins is discussed. A model of the 'closed form' GlnBP-Gln complex has been proposed based on the crystal structures of the histidine-binding protein-His complex and 'open form' GlnBP. This model has been successfully used as a search model in the crystal structure determination of the 'closed form' GlnBP-Gln complex by molecular replacement methods. The model agrees remarkably well with the crystal structure of the Gln-GlnBP complex with root-mean-square deviation of 1.29 {\AA}. Our study shows that, at least in our case, it is possible to predict one conformational state of a periplasmic binding protein from another conformational state of the protein. The glutamine-binding pockets of the model and the crystal structure are compared and the modeling technique is described.},

abstract = {To accurately predict protein conformations in atomic detail, a computational method must be capable of sampling models sufficiently close to the native structure. All-atom sampling is difficult because of the vast number of possible conformations and extremely rugged energy landscapes. Here, we test three sampling strategies to address these difficulties: conformational diversification, intensification of torsion and omega-angle sampling and parameter annealing. We evaluate these strategies in the context of the robotics-based kinematic closure (KIC) method for local conformational sampling in Rosetta on an established benchmark set of 45 12-residue protein segments without regular secondary structure. We quantify performance as the fraction of sub-Angstrom models generated. While improvements with individual strategies are only modest, the combination of intensification and annealing strategies into a new "next-generation KIC" method yields a four-fold increase over standard KIC in the median percentage of sub-Angstrom models across the dataset. Such improvements enable progress on more difficult problems, as demonstrated on longer segments, several of which could not be accurately remodeled with previous methods. Given its improved sampling capability, next-generation KIC should allow advances in other applications such as local conformational remodeling of multiple segments simultaneously, flexible backbone sequence design, and development of more accurate energy functions. {\textcopyright}2013 Stein, Kortemme.},

abstract = {Probabilistic inference is an attractive approach to uncertain reasoning and empirical learning in artificial intelligence. Computational difficulties arise, however, because probabilistic models with the necessary realism and flexibility lead to complex distributions over high-dimensional spaces.
Related problems in other fields have been tackled using Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using Markov chains, providing a rich array of techniques that can be applied to problems in artificial intelligence. The ``Metropolis algorithm'' has been used to solve difficult problems in statistical physics for over forty years, and, in the last few years, the related method of ``Gibbs sampling'' has been applied to problems of statistical inference. Concurrently, an alternative method for solving problems in statistical physics by means of dynamical simulation has been developed as well, and has recently been unified with the Metropolis algorithm to produce the ``hybrid Monte Carlo'' method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling is the basis of the heuristic optimization technique of ``simulated annealing'', and has recently been used in randomized algorithms for approximate counting of large sets.
In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic inference in artificial intelligence, present the theory of Markov chains, and describe various Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number of supporting techniques. I try to present a comprehensive picture of the range of methods that have been developed, including techniques from the varied literature that have not yet seen wide application in artificial intelligence, but which appear relevant. As illustrative examples, I use the problems of probabilistic inference in expert systems, discovery of latent classes from data, and Bayesian learning for neural networks.},

The approach is based on measurements of distance distributions between spin labels in the range between 2 and 6 nanometers by a pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance technique and explicit modeling of spin label conformations. By applying this method to the membrane protein homodimer of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA of Escherichia coli, the structure of the presumably physiological dimer was determined.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter-sodium symporters (NSS), targets for psychostimulants and therapeutic drugs, have a critical role in neurotransmission. Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl -independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium iong-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl- dependent. We reasoned that the negative chargeg-provided either by Cl- or by the transporter itselfg-is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na + gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na + /substrate symport elicited H + efflux, indicative of Na + /substrate symportg-coupled H + antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl- dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence. We propose unifying features of charge balance by all NSS members with similar mechanistic features but different molecular solutions. {\textcopyright}2010 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Binding and flux experiments showed that the two binding sites can be occupied simultaneously.

abstract = {The investigation of the structure and conforma-tional dynamics of biomolecules under physiological conditions is challenging for structural biology. Although pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (like PELDOR) techniques provide long-range distance and orientation information with high accuracy, such studies are usually performed at cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature (RT) PELDOR studies are seemingly impossible due to short electronic relaxation times and loss of dipolar interactions through rotational averaging. We incorporated the rigid nitroxide spin label C Â¸ into a DNA duplex and immobilized the sample on a solid support to overcome this limitation. This enabled orientation-selective PELDOR measurements at RT. A comparison with data recorded at 50 K revealed averaging of internal dynamics, which occur on the ns time range at RT. Thus, our approach adds a new method to study structural and dynamical processes at physiological temperature in the < 10 ms time range with atomistic resolution. Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrosco-py is established as a valued method for investigations of biomolecular structures and conformational flexibility, next to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and optical or infrared spectroscopy. Most common are pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called double electron-electron resonance/ DEER) [1, 2] or double quantum coherence (DQC) [3] experiments. These techniques rely on the detection of the magnetic dipolar interaction between unpaired electrons. For this purpose, two spin labels are covalently attached to specific sides of the system by side-directed spin labeling (SDSL). [4] Such labeling can be performed either during the synthesis of a biopolymer or post-synthetically. [5, 6] PELDOR spectrosco-py in combination with SDSL is not limited by the size of the molecules under investigation and can determine distances in the 1.5-10 nm range for nucleic acids, proteins, and their complexes. [7-9] Due to the intrinsically fast echo dephasing time of nitroxide spin labels at higher temperatures, PELDOR experiments are usually carried out in frozen solutions at % 50 K. [10] Thus, such experiments report on a static frozen conformational ensemble, providing the full conformational accessible space of flexible biomolecules at the freezing temperature. [11] However, freezing may trap biomolecules in specific conformations. Furthermore, cryo-protectants, necessary additives to form a good glass upon freezing, can also affect natural equilibria. [12] Additionally, kinetics for dynamic processes are not accessible in frozen solution. A longstanding goal is to relate PELDOR data acquired at low temperatures to physiological conditions. In order to perform PELDOR measurements at room temperature (RT), one needs to overcome two fundamental limitations which are not present in frozen solutions. First, the rotational motion of the molecules has to be inhibited to avoid averaging out the dipolar interaction. This can be achieved by, for example, immobilization on a solid support. Second, the transverse relaxation time T 2 of the spin label has to be long enough to obtain an appropriate time window for the evolution of the dipolar coupling. A proof of concept for RT DQC experiments has been demonstrated using triarylmethyl (TAM, trityl) labels attached to a biotin-immobilized protein [13] and on double-stranded DNA. [14, 15] As the echo-dephasing mechanism in the liquid phase is strongly driven by the anisotropy of the hyperfine-and g-tensor, the carbon-based trityl radicals with isotropic hyperfine couplings and very small g-tensor aniso-tropy are good candidates for RT experiments. However, incorporation of the bulky and hydrophobic trityl label into biomolecules is limited, for example, to end groups or loops and requires an adequate linker to overcome steric hindrance. [16-19] Spirocyclohexyl-derived nitroxides have also been utilized as spin labels on DNAs [15] and proteins [21] to obtain distance information by PELDOR at RT. Here the absence of the rotating methyl groups on the carbon atoms adjacent to the nitroxide functional groups leads to longer relaxation times. Nevertheless, for both trityls and spirocy-clohexyl nitroxides there are indications that the linkers and the attachment strategy still limit the transverse relaxation time T 2. [16] In the case of nitroxides, the molecules had to be immobilized in solid matrices to prevent the tumbling motion of the biomolecule and the nitroxide spin label. Polysugars, like trehalose and sucrose, exhibit great immobilization and Supporting information and the ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under: https://doi.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for understanding the conformational heterogeneity of proteins. It involves attaching nitroxide spin labels to two residues in the protein to obtain a distance distribution between them. However, the choice of residue pairs to label in the protein requires careful thought, as experimentalists must pick label positions from a large set of all possible residue-pair combinations in the protein. In this article, we address the problem of the choice of DEER spin-label positions in a protein. For this purpose, we utilize all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of protein dynamics, to rank the sets of labeled residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Our design methodology is based on the following two criteria: (1) An ideal set of DEER spin-label positions should capture the slowest conformational-change processes observed in the protein dynamics, and (2) any two sets of residue pairs should describe orthogonal conformational-change processes to maximize the overall information gain and reduce the number of labeled residue pairs. We utilize Markov state models of protein dynamics to identify slow dynamical processes and a genetic-algorithm-based approach to predict the optimal choices of residue pairs with limited computational time requirements. We predict the optimal residue pairs for DEER spectroscopy in $\beta$2 adrenergic receptor, the C-terminal domain of calmodulin, and peptide transporter PepTSo. We find that our choices were ranked higher than those used to perform DEER experiments on the proteins investigated in this study. Hence, the predicted choices of DEER residue pairs determined by our method provide maximum insight into the conformational heterogeneity of the protein while using the minimum number of labeled residues.},

abstract = {A hybrid protein structure determination approach combining sparse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) distance restraints and Rosetta de novo protein folding has been previously demonstrated to yield high quality models (Alexander et al. (2008)). However, widespread application of this methodology to proteins of unknown structures is hindered by the lack of a general strategy to place spin label pairs in the primary sequence. In this work, we report the development of an algorithm that optimally selects spin labeling positions for the purpose of distance measurements by EPR. For the $\alpha$-helical subdomain of T4 lysozyme (T4L), simulated restraints that maximize sequence separation between the two spin labels while simultaneously ensuring pairwise connectivity of secondary structure elements yielded vastly improved models by Rosetta folding. 54% of all these models have the correct fold compared to only 21% and 8% correctly folded models when randomly placed restraints or no restraints are used, respectively. Moreover, the improvements in model quality require a limited number of optimized restraints, which is determined by the pairwise connectivities of T4L $\alpha$-helices. The predicted improvement in Rosetta model quality was verified by experimental determination of distances between spin labels pairs selected by the algorithm. Overall, our results reinforce the rationale for the combined use of sparse EPR distance restraints and de novo folding. By alleviating the experimental bottleneck associated with restraint selection, this algorithm sets the stage for extending computational structure determination to larger, traditionally elusive protein topologies of critical structural and biochemical importance. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Recently discovered examples of decoding plasticity are particularly spectacular.

abstract = {Traditional methods to analyze interactions and conformational changes of proteins adsorbed onto biomaterials are limited by the protein's associations with the substrate material and the complexity of the surrounding media. We have used EPR spectroscopy in combination with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) to investigate single protein and competitive adsorption kinetics of horse hemoglobin (Hgb) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) on a silicaâcalciumâphosphate bioceramic substrate. Combined continuous wave and pulsed (DEER) EPR techniques were employed to monitor local mobility/flexibility changes within the proteins and tertiary structure dynamics upon adsorption. An alternate labeling technique was introduced to allow for specific quantification of each protein adsorbed to the bioceramic surface. We show that at buffer pH 7.4 and 4.7 the amount of adsorbed hemoglobin was increased by a factor of 4â5 compared with BSA. The tertiary structure of hemoglobin was strongly affected upon adsorption, leading to a dissociation of the tetrameric molecule into monomers or $\alpha$$\beta$ dimers. When the bioceramic substrate was previously functionalized with a layer of BSA, dissociation was reduced by 71 % compared with the untreated surface, indicating a âprimerâ effect of BSA for better adhesion of the globular hemoglobin.},

We found that acidic pH favors formation of an inward-facing (IF) conformation, whereas elevated pH (>7) and the substrate rhodamine 6G stabilizes an outward-facing (OF) conformation. The lipid-dependent PfMATE isomerization between OF and IF conformation is driven by protonation of a previously unidentified intracellular glutamate residue that is critical for drug resistance.

Here we used extensive double electron-electron resonance measurements to uncover the conformational equilibrium of LmrP, a multidrug transporter from Lactococcus lactis, and to investigate how protons and ligands shift this equilibrium to enable transport. We find that the transporter switches between outward-open and outward-closed conformations, depending on the protonation states of specific acidic residues forming a transmembrane protonation relay. Our data can be framed in a model of transport wherein substrate binding initiates the transport cycle by opening the extracellular side. Subsequent protonation of membrane-embedded acidic residues induces substrate release to the extracellular side and triggers a cascade of conformational changes that concludes in proton release to the intracellular side.},

It catalyzes antiport of His and some neutral amino acids such as Ile, Leu, Val, Cys, Met, Gln and Phe thus being involved in amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, LAT1 is over-expressed in many human cancers that are characterized by increased demand of amino acids. Therefore LAT1 was recently acknowledged as a novel target for cancer therapy. However, knowledge on molecular mechanism of LAT1 transport is still scarce. Methods Combined approaches of bioinformatics, site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification, and transport assay in proteoliposomes, have been adopted to unravel dark sides of human LAT1 structure/function relationships. Results It has been demonstrated that residues F252, S342, C335 are crucial for substrate recognition and C407 plays a minor role. C335 and C407 cannot be targeted by SH reagents. The transporter has a preferential dimeric structure and catalyzes an antiport reaction which follows a simultaneous random mechanism. Conclusions Critical residues of the substrate binding site of LAT1 have been probed. This site is not freely accessible by molecules other than substrate. Similarly to LeuT, K+ has some regulatory properties on LAT1. General significance The collected data represent a solid basis for deciphering molecular mechanism underlying LAT1 function.},

The strength of this hybrid approach is shown by an application to the flexible multidomain protein Hsp90. The average solution structure of Hsp90's closed state resembles the known X-ray crystal structure with Angstrom precision. The open state is represented by an ensemble of conformations with interdomain fluctuations of up to 25 {\AA}. The data reveal a state-specific suppression of the submillisecond fluctuations by dynamic protein-protein interaction.

AATs have diverse functional roles ranging from neurotransmission to acid-base balance, intracellular energy metabolism, and anabolic and catabolic reactions. In cancer cells and diabetes, dysregulation of AATs leads to metabolic reprogramming, which changes intracellular amino acid levels, contributing to the pathogenesis of cancer, obesity and diabetes. Indeed, the neutral amino acid transporters (NATs) SLC7A5/LAT1 and SLC1A5/ASCT2 are likely involved in several human malignancies. However, a clinical therapy that directly targets AATs has not yet been developed. The purpose of this review is to highlight the structural and functional diversity of AATs, their diverse physiological roles in different tissues and organs, their wide-ranging implications in human diseases and the emerging strategies and tools that will be necessary to target AATs therapeutically.},

The next stage involved docking of transporter inhibitors: Reboxetine, duloxetine, desipramine, and other commonly used drugs. The procedure revealed the molecular orientation of residues and disclosed ones that are the most important for ligand binding: Phenylalanine F72, aspartic acid D75, tyrosine Y152, and phenylalanine F317. Aspartic acid D75 plays a key role in recognition of the basic amino group present in monoamine transporter inhibitors and substrates.

As L-cystine is an essential precursor for glutathione synthesis, system xcâ supports tumor cell growth through glutathione-based oxidative stress resistance and is considered as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. System xcâ consists of two subunits, the light chain subunit SLC7A11 (xCT) and the heavy chain subunit SLC3A2 (also known as CD98hc or 4F2hc), which are linked by a conserved disulfide bridge. Although the recent structures of another SLC7 member, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) in complex with CD98hc, have provided the structural basis toward understanding the amino acid transport mechanism, the detailed molecular mechanism of xCT remains unknown. To revealthe molecular mechanism, we performed single-particle analyses of the xCT-CD98hc complex. As wild-type xCT-CD98hc displayed poor stability and could not be purified to homogeneity, we applied a consensus mutagenesis approach to xCT. The consensus mutated construct exhibited increased stability as compared to the wild-type, and enabled the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) map to be obtained at 6.2 {\AA}resolution by single-particle analysis. The cryo-EM map revealed sufficient electron density to assign secondary structures. In the xCT structure, the hash and arm domains are well resolved, whereas the bundle domain shows some flexibility. CD98hc is positioned next to the xCT transmembrane domain. This study provides the structural basis of xCT, and our consensus-based strategy could represent a good choice toward solving unstable protein structures.},

abstract = {Evidence has been presented that 5+5 TMS and 7+7 TMS inverted repeat fold transporters are members of a single superfamily named the Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation (APC) superfamily. However, the evolutionary relationship between the 5+5 and the 7+7 topological types has not been established. We have identified a common fold, consisting of a spiny membrane helix/sheet, followed by a U-like structure and a V-like structure that is recurrent between domain duplicated units of 5+5 and 7+7 inverted repeat folds. This fold is found in the following protein structures: AdiC, ApcT, LeuT, Mhp1, BetP, CaiT, and SglT (all 5+5 TMS repeats), as well as UraA and SulP (7+7 TMS repeats). AdiC, LeuT and Mhp1 have two extra TMSs after the second duplicated domain, SglT has four extra C-terminal TMSs, and BetP has two extra TMSs before the first duplicated domain. UraA and SulP on the other hand have two extra TMSs at the N-terminus of each duplicated domain unit. These observations imply that multiple hairpin and domain duplication events occurred during the evolution of the APC superfamily. We suggest that the five TMS architecture was primordial and that families gained two TMSs on either side of this basic structure via dissimilar hairpin duplications either before or after intragenic duplication. Evidence for homology between TMSs 1-2 of AdiC and TMSs 1-2 and 3-4 of UraA suggests that the 7+7 topology arose via an internal duplication of the N-terminal hairpin loop within the five TMS repeat unit followed by duplication of the 7 TMS domain. {\textcopyright}2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Herein we present a computational technique for generating helix-membrane protein folds matching a predefined set of distance constraints, such as those obtained from NMR NOE, chemical cross-linking, dipolar EPR, and FRET experiments. The purpose of the technique is to provide initial structures for local conformational searches based on either energetic considerations or ad-hoc scoring criteria. In order to properly screen the conformational space, the technique generates an exhaustive list of conformations within a specified root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) where the helices are positioned in order to match the provided distances. Our results indicate that the number of structures decreases exponentially as the number of distances increases, and increases exponentially as the errors associated with the distances increases. We also found the number of solutions to be smaller when all the distances share one helix in common, compared to the case where the distances connect helices in a daisy-chain manner. We found that for 7 helices, at least 15 distances with errors up to 8 A are needed to produce a number of solutions that is not too large to be processed by local search refinement procedures. Finally, without energetic considerations, our enumeration technique retrieved the transmembrane domains of Bacteriorhodopsin (PDB entry1c3w), Halorhodopsin (1e12), Rhodopsin (1f88), Aquaporin-1 (1fqy), Glycerol uptake facilitator protein (1fx8), Sensory Rhodopsin (1jgj), and a subunit of Fumarate reductase flavoprotein (1qlaC) with Calpha level RMSDs of 3.0 A, 2.3 A, 3.2 A, 4.6 A, 6.0 A, 3.7 A, and 4.4 A, respectively.},

Here we analyzed the spin-labeled V1 side chain, which is internally anchored and hence less flexible. Crystal structures of V1-labeled T4 lysozyme constructs carrying the V1 side chain on $\alpha$-helical segments suggest that V1 side chains adopt only a few discrete rotamers.

abstract = {We discuss excluded volume effects on the background signal of double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments. Assuming spherically symmetric pervaded volumes, an analytical expression of the background signal is derived based on the shell-factorization approach. The effects of crowding and off-center label positions are discussed. Crowding is taken into account using the Percus-Yevick approximation for the radial distribution function of the particle centers. In addition, a versatile approach relating the pair-correlation function of the particle centers with those of off-center labels is introduced. Limiting expressions applying to short and long dipolar evolution times are derived. Furthermore, we show under which conditions the background with significant excluded volume effects resembles that originating from a fractal dimensionality ranging from 3 to 6. DEER time domain data of spin-probed samples of human serum albumin (HSA) are shown to be strongly affected by excluded-volume effects. The excluded volume is determined from the simultaneous analysis of spectra recorded at various protein concentrations but a constant probe-to-protein ratio. The spin-probes 5-DOXYL-stearic acid (5-DSA) and 16-DOXYL-stearic acid (16-DSA) are used, which, when taken up by HSA, give rise to broad and well-defined distance distributions, respectively. We compare different, model-free approaches of analyzing these data. The most promising results are obtained by the concurrent Tikhonov regularization of all spectra when a common background model is simultaneously adjusted such that the a posteriori probability is maximized. For the samples of 16-DSA in HSA, this is the only approach that allows suppressing a background artifact. We suggest that the delineated simultaneous analysis procedure can be generally applied to reduce ambiguities related to the ill-posed extraction of distance distributions from DEER spectra. This approach is particularly valuable for dipolar signals resulting from broad distance distributions, which as a consequence, are devoid of explicit dipolar oscillations. {\textcopyright}2013 American Chemical Society.},

The ACE2-B0AT1 complex is assembled as a dimer of heterodimers, with the collectrin-like domain of ACE2 mediating homodimerization. The RBD is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through polar residues.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS)1 mediate sodium-dependent reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are targets for many psychoactive drugs. The crystal structure of the prokaryotic NSS protein, LeuT, was recently solved at high resolution; however, the mechanistic details of regulation of the permeation pathway in this class of proteins remain unknown. Here we combine computational modeling and experimental probing in the dopamine transporter (DAT) to demonstrate the functional importance of a conserved intracellular interaction network. Our data suggest that a salt bridge between Arg-60 in the N terminus close to the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment (TM) 1 and Asp-436 at the cytoplasmic end of TM8 is stabilized by a cation-$\pi$ interaction between Arg-60 and Tyr-335 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Computational probing illustrates how the interactions may determine the flexibility of the permeation pathway, and mutagenesis within the network and results from assays of transport, as well as the state-dependent accessibility of a substituted cysteine in TM3, support the role of this network in regulating access between the substrate binding site and the intracellular milieu. The mechanism that emerges from these findings may be unique to the NSS family, where the local disruption of ionic interactions modulates the transition of the transporter between the outward- and inward-facing conformations. {\textcopyright}2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of ecological structures originates either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes. In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Only a few established channel-forming proteins appear to have evolved via other pathways. The proposed pathway for the evolutionary appearance of the five types of transport proteins involved intragenic duplication of transmembrane pore-forming peptide-encoding genes, giving rise to channel proteins. These gave rise to single protein secondary carriers which upon superimposition of addition protein domains and proteins, including energy-coupling proteins and extracytoplasmic receptors, gave rise to multidomain, multicomponent carriers, primary active transporters and group translocators.

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the stability, structure, dynamics, and function of many proteins differ in cells versus in vitro. The determination of protein structure and dynamics within the native cellular environment may lead to better understanding of protein behavior. Electron spin resonance (ESR) has emerged as a technique that can report on protein structure and dynamics within cells. Nitroxide based spin labels are capable of reporting on protein dynamics, structure, and backbone flexibility but are limited due to nitroxide reduction occurring in cells. In order to overcome this limitation, we used the oxidizing agent potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ) as well as the cleavage resistant spin label 3-malemido-PROXYL (5-MSL). Furthermore, we hypothesized that injection concentration is an important parameter regarding nitroxide reduction kinetics. By increasing the injection concentration of doubly 5-MSL labeled protein into Xenopus laevis oocytes, we found an increased nitroxide lifetime. Our work demonstrates unprecedented incubation times of 3-h in-cell and 5-h in-cytosol for double electronâelectron resonance (DEER) experiments using nitroxide spin labels. This allows for more meaningful measurements of larger protein systems which may require longer incubation times for equilibration in the cellular milieu. Even longer incubation times are possible by combining our approach with more shielded nitroxides and Q-band.},

abstract = {An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package "DeerAnalysis" (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids. Our goal is to present our advances in order to aid readers in similar applications.},

abstract = {Protein loop closure constitutes a critical step in loop and protein modeling whereby geometrically feasible loops must be found between two given anchor residues. Here, a new analytic/iterative algorithm denoted random coordinate descent (RCD) to perform protein loop closure is described. The algorithm solves loop closure through minimization as in cyclic coordinate descent but selects bonds for optimization randomly, updates loop conformations by spinor-matrices, performs loop closure in both chain directions, and uses a set of geometric filters to yield efficient conformational sampling. Geometric filters allow one to detect clashes and constrain dihedral angles on the fly. The RCD algorithm is at least comparable to state of the art loop closure algorithms due to an excellent balance between efficiency and intrinsic sampling capability. Furthermore, its efficiency allows one to improve conformational sampling by increasing the sampling number without much penalty. Overall, RCD turns out to be accurate, fast, robust, and applicable over a wide range of loop lengths. Because of the versatility of RCD, it is a solid alternative for integration with current loop modeling strategies. {\textcopyright}2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In metabolism, available free energy is limited and must be divided across pathway steps to maintain a negative $\Delta$G throughout. For each reaction, $\Delta$G is log proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain a unified set of concentrations and $\Delta$G for each organism. In glycolysis, we find that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes associated with $\Delta$G near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite concentrations and $\Delta$G are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints.},

We find that PIP2 shifts the conformational equilibrium of GHSR away from its inactive state, favoring basal and agonist-induced G protein activation. This occurs because of a preferential binding of PIP2 to specific intracellular sites in the receptor active state. Another lipid, GM3, also binds GHSR and favors G protein activation, but mostly in a ghrelin-dependent manner. Finally, we find that not only selective interactions but also the thickness of the bilayer reshapes the conformational repertoire of GHSR, with direct consequences on G protein selectivity. Taken together, this data illuminates the multifaceted role of the membrane components as allosteric modulators of how ghrelin signal could be propagated.},

Here, we report EPR double electron-electron resonance (DEER) studies on the most ubiquitous GCAP isoform, GCAP1 and site-directed mutagenesis analysis to determine an atomic resolution structural model of a GCAP1 dimer. Nitroxide spin-label probes were introduced at individual GCAP1 residues: T29C, E57C, E133C, and E154C. The intermolecular distance of each spin-label probe (measured by DEER) defined restraints for calculating the GCAP1 dimeric structure by molecular docking. The DEER-derived structural model of the GCAP1 dimer was similar within the experimental error for both the Mg2+-bound activator and Ca2+-bound inhibitor states (RMSD < 2.0 {\AA}). The GCAP1 dimer possesses intermolecular hydrophobic contacts involving the side chain atoms of H19, Y22, F73 and V77. The structural model of the dimer was validated by GCAP1 mutations (H19R, Y22D, F73E, and V77E) at the dimer interface that each abolished protein dimerization. Previous studies have shown that each of these mutants either diminished or completely suppressed the ability of GCAP1 to activate the cyclase. These results suggest that GCAP1 dimerization may affect compartmentalization of GCAP1 in the photoreceptors and/or affect regulation of the cyclase activity.},

NMR was used to characterize the secondary structure and dynamics of MetO-$\lambda$LS in standard phosphate buffer. 13C$\alpha$ and 1H$\alpha$ chemical shift indices reveal a region of significant helicity between residues 9 and 29. This helical content is further supported by the observation of medium-range amide NOEs. The remaining residues do not exhibit significant helicity as determined by NMR. We determined 15N relaxation parameters for 64 of 85 residues at 600 and 800 MHz. There are two distinct regions of reduced flexibility, residues 8-32 in the N-terminal third and residues 50-83 in the C-terminal third. The middle third, residues 33-50, has greater flexibility. We have analyzed the amplitude of the backbone motions in terms of the physical properties of the amino acids and conclude that conformational restriction of the backbone MetO-$\lambda$LS is due to nascent helix formation in the region corresponding to native helix 1. The bulkiness of amino acid residues in the C-terminal third leads to the potential for hydrophobic interactions, which is suggested by chemical exchange detected by the difference in spectral density J(0) at the two static magnetic fields. The more flexible middle region is the result of a predominance of small side chains in this region. {\textcopyright}2007 American Chemical Society.},

To unload, the two domains of a PBP open up, allowing the ligand to exit. However, it is not clear whether there are dynamics near the binding site which can facilitate the rapid dissociation of a ligand. To visualize such dynamics, we utilized paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR and introduced a rigid paramagnetic probe to a PBP, glutamine-binding protein (QBP) with its cognate ligand bound. A paramagnetic Cu(II) ion is sandwiched between an engineered di-histidine motif at a helix and an NTA capping molecule. The afforded paramagnetic probe is so rigid that PRE values calculated from a single structure of holo QBP largely agree with the observed values. The remaining PRE discrepancies, however, manifest dynamics of a loop in the opposite domain from the paramagnetic probe. This loop packs against the glutamine ligand in the holo QBP and undergoes fluctuations upon ligand dissociation, as assessed by steered molecular dynamics simulations. As such, the loop dynamics, occurring for a small population in nanosecond to microsecond time scale, may be related to the ligand dissociation process.

One limitation to these measurements is the unknown position of the spin label relative to the protein backbone. To overcome this drawback, we introduce a rotamer library of the methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL) into the protein modeling program Rosetta. Spin label rotamers were derived from conformations observed in crystal structures of spin labeled T4 lysozyme and previously published molecular dynamics simulations. Rosetta's ability to accurately recover spin label conformations and EPR measured distance distributions was evaluated against 19 experimentally determined MTSSL labeled structures of T4 lysozyme and the membrane protein LeuT and 73 distance distributions from T4 lysozyme and the membrane protein MsbA. For a site in the core of T4 lysozyme, the correct spin label conformation (Î§1 and Î§2) is recovered in 99.8% of trials. In surface positions 53% of the trajectories agree with crystallized conformations in Î§1 and Î§2. This level of recovery is on par with Rosetta performance for the 20 natural amino acids. In addition, Rosetta predicts the distance between two spin labels with a mean error of 4.4 {\AA}. The width of the experimental distance distribution, which reflects the flexibility of the two spin labels, is predicted with a mean error of 1.3 {\AA}.

abstract = {Structure determination remains a challenge for many biologically important proteins. In particular, proteins that adopt multiple conformations often evade crystallization in all biologically relevant states. Although computational de novo protein folding approaches often sample biologically relevant conformations, the selection of the most accurate model for different functional states remains a formidable challenge, in particular, for proteins with more than about 150 residues. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can obtain limited structural information for proteins in well-defined biological states and thereby assist in selecting biologically relevant conformations. The present study demonstrates that de novo folding methods are able to accurately sample the folds of 192-residue long soluble monomeric Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). The tertiary structures of the monomeric and homodimeric forms of BAX were predicted using the primary structure as well as 25 and 11 EPR distance restraints, respectively.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) couple the uptake of neurotransmitter with one or more sodium ions1-3, removing neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. NSSs are essential to the function of chemical synapses, are associated with multiple neurological diseases and disorders4, and are the targets of therapeutic and illicit drugs 5. LeuT, a prokaryotic orthologue of the NSS family, is a model transporter for understanding the relationships between molecular mechanism and atomic structure in a broad range of sodium-dependent and sodium-independent secondary transporters6-13. At present there is a controversy over whether there are one or two high-affinity substrate binding sites in LeuT. The first-reported crystal structure of LeuT, together with subsequent functional and structural studies, provided direct evidence for a single, high-affinity, centrally located substrate-binding site, defined as the S1 site 14,15. Recent binding, flux and molecular simulation studies, however, have been interpreted in terms of a model where there are two high-affinity binding sites: the central, S1, site and a second, the S2 site, located within the extracellular vestibule16. Furthermore, it was proposed that the S1 and S2 sites are allosterically coupled such that occupancy of the S2 site is required for the cytoplasmic release of substrate from the S1 site16. Here we address this controversy by performing direct measurement of substrate binding to wild-type LeuT and to S2 site mutants using isothermal titration calorimetry, equilibrium dialysis and scintillation proximity assays. In addition, we perform uptake experiments to determine whether the proposed allosteric coupling between the putative S2 site and the S1 site manifests itself in the kinetics of substrate flux. We conclude that LeuT harbours a single, centrally located, high-affinity substrate-binding site and that transport is well described by a simple, single-substrate kinetic mechanism. {\textcopyright}2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

In this manuscript, we demonstrate the value of distance measurements for differentiating competing structural models on the dimerization of the effector domain (ED) of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza A virus. Our results show NS1 to be well amenable to nanometer distance measurements by EPR, yielding high quality data. In combination with mutants perturbing protein dimerization and in silico prediction based on crystal structures, we can exclude one of two potential dimerization interfaces. Furthermore, our results lead to a viable hypothesis of a NS1 ED:ED interface which is flexible through rotation around the vector interconnecting the two native cysteines.

Stoichiometry is known for a wide array of mammalian transporters, but, due to a lack of readily available tools, not for most of the prokaryotic transporters for which high-resolution structures are available. Here, we describe a general method for using radiolabeled substrate flux assays to determine coupling stoichiometries of electrogenic secondary active transporters reconstituted in proteoliposomes by measuring transporter equilibrium potentials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining the coupling stoichiometry of VcINDY, a bacterial Na+-coupled succinate transporter, and further validate it by confirming the coupling stoichiometry of vSGLT, a bacterial sugar transporter. This robust thermodynamic method should be especially useful in probing the mechanisms of transporters with available structures.},

Here we present the first crystal structure of SLC38A9 from Danio rerio in complex with arginine. As captured in the cytosol-open state, the bound arginine was locked in a transitional state stabilized by transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) of drSLC38A9, which was anchored at the groove between TM5 and TM7. These anchoring interactions were mediated by the highly conserved WNTMM motif in TM1, and mutations in this motif abolished arginine transport by drSLC38A9. The underlying mechanism of substrate binding is critical for sensitizing the mTORC1 signaling pathway to amino acids and for maintenance of lysosomal amino acid homeostasis.

For each labeled duplex, four simulations were performed with SP/SP R P/RP SP/RP, and RP/S P labels, with initial all trans label conformations. Another set of four simulations was performed for the 7/19-labeled duplex using a different label starting conformation. The average internitroxide distance ãr MDã was within 0.2 {\AA}for the two sets of simulations for the 7/19-labeled duplex, indicating sufficient sampling of conformational space. For all three labeled duplexes studied, ãrMDã agreed with experimental values, as well as with average distances obtained from an efficient conformer search algorithm (NASNOX).

abstract = {The X-ray crystal structure of adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyltransferase (CobU) from Salmonella typhimurium bound to GMP has been determined by molecular replacement to 2.2 {\AA}resolution. CobU is a bifunctional enzyme, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 1-amino-O-2-propanol side chain of the adenosylcobinamide ring and subsequently functions as a guanylyltransferase to form adenosylcobinamide. GDP. The transferase activity involves a covalent enzyme-guanylyl intermediate that is most likely a phosphoramidate linkage to His46. Previous studies have shown that the enzyme is a homotrimer and adopts a pinwheel shape. Each subunit consists of a single domain of six parallel $\beta$-strands and one antiparallel strand flanked on either side by a total of five $\alpha$-helices and one helical turn. Interestingly, His46 in the apoenzyme is located a considerable distance from the kinase active site or P-loop motif and is solvent-exposed [Thompson, T. B., et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 7686-7695]. To examine the structural relationship of the two active sites, CobU was cocrystallized with GTP and pyrophosphate. Crystals belong to space group P212121 with the following unit cell dimensions: a = 58.4 {\AA}, b = 87.8 {\AA}, and c = 101.6 {\AA}. The structure shows electron density for the hydrolysis product GMP rather than the expected covalent guanylyl intermediate which appears to have been hydrolyzed in the crystal lattice. Even so, CobU exhibits a substantial conformational rearrangement. The helix axis containing His46, the site of guanylylation, rotates 30Â°and translates 11 relative to the apo structure and is accompanied by compensatory unwinding and rewinding at the helix ends to allow the induction of a guanosine binding pocket between $\beta$-strand 2 and $\alpha$- helix 2. This conformational change brings the C($\alpha$) of His46 approximately 10 {\AA}closer to the P-loop motif such that a phosphate ion located in the P- loop is only 6 {\AA}from the $\alpha$-phosphate of GMP. This suggests that the P-loop motif may be used to coordinate the terminal phosphates in both the transferase and kinase reactions and implies that the active sites for both reactions overlap.},

However, the conformational changes that accompany substrate transport, the mechanism by which a substrate moves through the transporter, and principles of competitive inhibition remain unclear. We used crystallographic and functional studies on the leucine transporter (LeuT), a model for neurotransmitter sodium symporters, to show that various amino acid substrates induce the same occluded conformational state and that a competitive inhibitor, tryptophan (Trp), traps LeuT in an open-to-out conformation. In the Trp complex, the extracellular gate residues arginine 30 and aspartic acid 404 define a second weak binding site for substrates or inhibitors as they permeate from the extracellular solution to the primary substrate site, which demonstrates how residues that participate in gating also mediate permeation.},

abstract = {The conformational distribution of the N-terminal domain of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHCIIb) has been characterized by electron-electron double resonance yielding distances between spin labels placed in various domains of the protein. Distance distributions involving residue 3 near the N terminus turned out to be bimodal, revealing that this domain, which is involved in regulatory functions such as balancing the energy flow through photosystems (PS) I and II, exists in at least two conformational states. Models of the conformational sub-ensembles were generated on the basis of experimental distance restraints from measurements on LHCIIb monomers and then checked for consistency with the experimental distance distribution between residues 3 in trimers. Only models where residue 3 is located above the core of the protein and extends into the aqueous phase on the stromal side fit the trimer data. In the other state, which consequently is populated only in monomers, the N-terminal domain extends sideways from the protein core. The two conformational states may correspond to two functional states of LHCIIb, namely trimeric LHCIIb associated with PSII in stacked thylakoid membranes and presumably monomeric LHCIIb associated with PSI in nonstacked thylakoids. The switch between these two is known to be triggered by phosphorylation of Thr-6. A similar phosphorylation-induced conformational change of the N-terminal domain has been observed by others in bovine annexin IV which, due to the conformational switch, also loses its membrane-aggregating property. {\textcopyright}2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins in their native, hydrophobic environment is important to understanding how these proteins function. EPR spectroscopy in combination with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) can measure dynamics and structure of membrane proteins in their native lipid environment; however, until now the dynamics measured have been qualitative due to limited knowledge of the nitroxide spin label's intramolecular motion in the hydrophobic environment. Although several studies have elucidated the structural origins of EPR line shapes of water-soluble proteins, EPR spectra of nitroxide spin-labeled proteins in detergents or lipids have characteristic differences from their water-soluble counterparts, suggesting significant differences in the underlying molecular motion of the spin label between the two environments. To elucidate these differences, membrane-exposed $\alpha$-helical sites of the leucine transporter, LeuT, from Aquifex aeolicus, were investigated using X-ray crystallography, mutational analysis, nitroxide side chain derivatives, and spectral simulations in order to obtain a motional model of the nitroxide. For each crystal structure, the nitroxide ring of a disulfide-linked spin label side chain (R1) is resolved and makes contacts with hydrophobic residues on the protein surface. The spin label at site I204 on LeuT makes a nontraditional hydrogen bond with the ortho-hydrogen on its nearest neighbor F208, whereas the spin label at site F177 makes multiple van der Waals contacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed with an adjacent helix. These results coupled with the spectral effect of mutating the i Â± 3, 4 residues suggest that the spin label has a greater affinity for its local protein environment in the low dielectric than on a water-soluble protein surface. The simulations of the EPR spectra presented here suggest the spin label oscillates about the terminal bond nearest the ring while maintaining weak contact with the protein surface. Combined, the results provide a starting point for determining a motional model for R1 on membrane proteins, allowing quantification of nitroxide dynamics in the aliphatic environment of detergent and lipids. In addition, initial contributions to a rotamer library of R1 on membrane proteins are provided, which will assist in reliably modeling the R1 conformational space for pulsed dipolar EPR and NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement distance determination. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

On the other hand, experimental x-ray B-factors are used frequently to study local structural heterogeneity and dynamics in macromolecules by providing direct information about root mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) that can also be calculated from molecular dynamics simulations. We provide a mathematical derivation showing that, given a set of conservative assumptions, a root mean-square ensemble-average of an all-against-all distribution of pairwise RMSD for a single molecular species, ãRMSD2ã 1/2, is directly related to average B-factors (ãBã) and ãRMSF2ã1/2. We show this relationship and explore its limits of validity on a heterogeneous ensemble of structures taken from molecular dynamics simulations of villin headpiece generated using distributed-computing techniques and the Folding@Home cluster. Our results provide a basis for quantifying global structural diversity of macromolecules in crystals directly from x-ray experiments, and we show this on a large set of structures taken from the Protein Data Bank. In particular, we show that the ensemble-average pairwise backbone RMSD for a microscopic ensemble underlying a typical protein x-ray structure is â¼1.1 {\AA}, under the assumption that the principal contribution to experimental B-factors is conformational variability. {\textcopyright}2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Human neurotransmitter transporters are found in the nervous system terminating synaptic signals by rapid removal of neurotransmitter molecules from the synaptic cleft. The homologous transporter LeuT, found in Aquifex aeolicus, was crystallized in different conformations. Here, we investigated the inward-open state of LeuT. We compared LeuT in membranes and micelles using molecular dynamics simulations and lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer (LRET). Simulations of micelle-solubilized LeuT revealed a stable and widely open inward-facing conformation. However, this conformation was unstable in a membrane environment. The helix dipole and the charged amino acid of the first transmembrane helix (TM1A) partitioned out of the hydrophobic membrane core. Free energy calculations showed that movement of TM1A by 0.30 nm was driven by a free energy difference of $\sim$15 kJ/mol. Distance measurements by LRET showed TM1A movements, consistent with the simulations, confirming a substantially different inward-open conformation in lipid bilayer from that inferred from the crystal structure.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters couple the free energy of the electrochemical potential of one solute to the transmembrane movement of another. As a basic mechanistic explanation for their transport function the model of alternating access was put forward more than 40 years ago, and has been supported by numerous kinetic, biochemical and biophysical studies. According to this model, the transporter exposes its substrate binding site(s) to one side of the membrane or the other during transport catalysis, requiring a substantial conformational change of the carrier protein. In the light of recent structural data for a number of secondary transport proteins, we analyze the model of alternating access in more detail, and correlate it with specific structural and chemical properties of the transporters, such as their assignment to different functional states in the catalytic cycle of the respective transporter, the definition of substrate binding sites, the type of movement of the central part of the carrier harboring the substrate binding site, as well as the impact of symmetry on fold-specific conformational changes. Besides mediating the transmembrane movement of solutes, the mechanism of secondary carriers inherently involves a mechanistic coupling of substrate flux to the electrochemical potential of co-substrate ions or solutes. Mainly because of limitations in resolution of available transporter structures, this important aspect of secondary transport cannot yet be substantiated by structural data to the same extent as the conformational change aspect. We summarize the concepts of coupling in secondary transport and discuss them in the context of the available evidence for ion binding to specific sites and the impact of the ions on the conformational state of the carrier protein, which together lead to mechanistic models for coupling. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Contrary to popular assumption, the rate of growth of structural data has slowed, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has not been growing exponentially since 1995. Reaching such a dramatic conclusion requires careful measurement of growth of novel structures, which can be achieved by clustering entry sequences, or by using a novel index to down-weight entries with a higher number of sequence neighbors. These measures agree, and growth rates are very similar for entire PDB files, clusters, and weighted chains. The overall sizes of Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) categories (number of families, superfamilies, and folds) appear to be directly proportional to the number of deposited PDB files. Using our weighted chain count, which is most correlated to the change in the size of each SCOP category in anytime period, shows that the rate of increase of SCOP categories is actually slowing down. This enables the final size of each of these SCOP categories to be predicted without examining or comparing protein structures. In the last 3 years, structures solved by structural genomics (SG) initiatives, especially the United States National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative, have begun to redress the slowing growth of the PDB. Structures solved by SG are 3.8 times less sequence-redundant than typical PDB structures. Since mid-2004, SG programs have contributed half the novel structures measured by weighted chain counts. Our analysis does not rely on visual inspection of coordinate sets: it is done automatically, providing an accurate, up-to-date measure of the growth of novel protein structural data. {\textcopyright}2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) at W-band (95 GHz) was applied to measure the distance between a pair of nitroxide and Gd3+ chelate spin labels, about 6 nm apart, in a homodimer of the protein ERp29. While high-field DEER measurements on systems with such mixed labels can be highly attractive in terms of sensitivity and the potential to access long distances, a major difficulty arises from the large frequency spacing (about 700 MHz) between the narrow, intense signal of the Gd3+ central transition and the nitroxide signal. This is particularly problematic when using standard single-mode cavities. Here we show that a novel dual-mode cavity that matches this large frequency separation dramatically increases the sensitivity of DEER measurements, allowing evolution times as long as 12 $\mu$s in a protein. This opens the possibility of accessing distances of 8 nm and longer. In addition, orientation selection can be resolved and analyzed, thus providing additional structural information. In the case of W-band DEER on a Gd3+- nitroxide pair, only two angles and their distributions have to be determined, which is a much simpler problem to solve than the five angles and their distributions associated with two nitroxide spin labels. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measures distances between spin labels attached at well-defined sites in a protein and thus has the potential to report on conformational states of proteins in cells. In this work, we evaluate the suitability of the small and rigid 4PS-PyMTA-Gd(III) spin label for in-cell distance measurements. Three ubiquitin double mutants were labeled with 4PS-PyMTA-Gd(III) and delivered into human HeLa cells by electroporation (EP) and hypotonic swelling (HS). Gd(III)-Gd(III) DEER measurements were carried out on cells frozen after different incubation times, following delivery to test the stability of the spin label inside the cell. For both delivery methods, it was possible to derive distance distributions up to 12 h after delivery, although we observed a decrease in the amount of the delivered protein with time. Surprisingly, only one mutant reported a significant change in the distance distribution with time and only for HS delivery. On the basis of in vitro exchange experiments with Mn(II) and comparison with the same mutant labeled with BrPSPy-DO3MA-Gd(III) and considering the presence of Mn(II) in the cell, we hypothesized that the change occurred as a consequence of partial Gd(III)/Mn(II) exchange with endogenous Mn(II). These experiments also showed that the relative Gd(III)/Mn(II) binding affinity depends on the labeling site in the protein, which accounts for the lack of change with the other mutants delivered under HS conditions. We conclude that 4PS-PyMTA-Gd(III) is a good spin label for in-cell DEER for delivery by EP, but caution should be taken when HS is used.},

In PELDOR the ESR spectrum is excited by two ESE pulses at frequency $\omega$a, and additional pumping pulse at $\omega$b.Decay function V(T) of the ESE signal, when the time interval T between the first ESE pulse and pumping pulse is varied, contains the information on dipole-dipole couplings in the spin system. The kinetics of V(T) decay strongly depends upon distance, mutual orientation inside interacting spin pairs and space distribution of radicals throughout the sample.

abstract = {Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is being applied to ever more complex biological systems comprising multiple subunits. Membrane channel proteins are of great interest as pulse EPR reports on functionally significant but distinct conformational states in a native environment without the need for crystallization. Pulse EPR, in the form of pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR), using site-directed spin labeling, is most commonly employed to accurately determine distances (in the nanometer range) between different regions of the structure. However, PELDOR data analysis is more challenging in systems containing more than two spins (e.g., homomultimers) due to distorting multispin effects. Without suppression of these effects, much of the information contained in PELDOR data cannot be reliably retrieved. Thus, it is of utmost importance for future PELDOR applications in structural biology to develop suitable approaches that can overcome the multispin problem. Here, two different approaches for suppressing multispin effects in PELDOR, sparse labeling of the protein (reducing the labeling efficiency f) and reducing the excitation probability of spins ($\lambda$), are compared on two distinct bacterial mechanosensitive channels. For both the pentameric channel of large conductance (MscL) and the heptameric channel of small conductance (MscS) of Escherichia coli, mutants containing a spin label in the cytosolic or the transmembrane region were tested. Data demonstrate that distance distributions can be significantly improved with either approach compared to the standard PELDOR measurement, and confirm that $\lambda$ < 1/(nâ1) is needed to sufficiently suppress multispin effects (with n being the number of spins in the system). A clear advantage of the sparse labeling approach is demonstrated for the cytosolic mutants due to a significantly smaller loss in sensitivity. For the transmembrane mutants, this advantage is less pronounced but still useful for MscS, but performance is inferior for MscL possibly due to structural perturbations by the bulkier diamagnetic spin label analog.},

abstract = {Binding of Zn2+ to the endogenous Zn2+ binding site in the human dopamine transporter leads to potent inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake. Here we show that mutation of an intracellular tyrosine to alanine (Y335A) converts this inhibitory Zn2+ switch into an activating Zn2+ switch, allowing Zn2+-dependent activation of the transporter. The tyrosine is part of a conserved YXX$\Phi$ trafficking motif (X is any residue and $\Phi$ is a residue with a bulky hydrophobic group), but Y335A did not show alterations in surface targeting or protein kinase C-mediated internalization. Despite wild-type levels of surface expression, Y335A displayed a dramatic decrease in [3H]dopamine uptake velocity (Vmax) to less than 1% of the wild type. In addition, Y335A showed up to 150-fold decreases in the apparent affinity for cocaine, mazindol, and related inhibitors whereas the apparent affinity for several substrates was increased. However, the presence of Zn2+ in micromolar concentrations increased the Vmax up to 24-fold and partially restored the apparent affinities. The capability of Zn2+ to restore transport is consistent with a reversible, constitutive shift in the distribution of conformational states in the transport cycle upon mutation of Tyr-335. We propose that this shift is caused by disruption of intramolecular interactions important for stabilizing the transporter in a conformation in which extracellular substrate can bind and initiate transport, and accordingly that Tyr-335 is critical for regulating isomerization between discrete states in the transport cycle.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) is often used for the structural characterization of proteins that elude other techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, high-resolution structures are difficult to obtain due to uncertainty in the spin label location and sparseness of experimental data. Here, we introduce RosettaEPR, which has been designed to improve de novo high-resolution protein structure prediction using sparse SDSL-EPR distance data. The "motion-on-a-cone" spin label model is converted into a knowledge-based potential, which was implemented as a scoring term in Rosetta. RosettaEPR increased the fractions of correctly folded models (RMSDC$\alpha$<7.5. {\AA}) and models accurate at medium resolution (RMSDC$\alpha$<3.5. {\AA}) by 25%. The correlation of score and model quality increased from 0.42 when using no restraints to 0.51 when using bounded restraints and again to 0.62 when using RosettaEPR. This allowed for the selection of accurate models by score. After full-atom refinement, RosettaEPR yielded a 1.7. {\AA}model of T4-lysozyme, thus indicating that atomic detail models can be achieved by combining sparse EPR data with Rosetta. While these results indicate RosettaEPR's potential utility in high-resolution protein structure prediction, they are based on a single example. In order to affirm the method's general performance, it must be tested on a larger and more versatile dataset of proteins. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Mhp1 has been crystallized in three forms (outward-facing open, outward-facing occluded with substrate bound, and inward-facing open). We show that one natural cysteine residue, Cys327, out of three, has an enhanced solvent accessibility in the inward-facing (relative to the outward-facing) form. Reaction of the purified protein, in detergent, with the thiol-reactive N-ethylmalemide (NEM), results in modification of Cys327, suggesting that Mhp1 adopts predominantly inward-facing conformations. Addition of either sodium ions or the substrate 5-benzyl-l-hydantoin (L-BH) does not shift this conformational equilibrium, but systematic co-addition of the two results in an attenuation of labeling, indicating a shift toward outward-facing conformations that can be interpreted using conventional enzyme kinetic analyses. Such measurements can afford the Km for each ligand as well as the stoichiometry of ion-substrate-coupled conformational changes. Mutations that perturb the substrate binding site either result in the protein being unable to adopt outward-facing conformations or in a global destabilization of structure. The methodology combines covalent labeling, mass spectrometry, and kinetic analyses in a straightforward workflow applicable to a range of systems, enabling the interrogation of changes in a protein's conformation required for function at varied concentrations of substrates, and the consequences of mutations on these conformational transitions.},

abstract = {The properties of the conformational landscape of a biomolecule are of capital importance to understand its function. It is widely accepted that a statistical ensemble is far more representative than a single structure, especially for proteins with disordered regions. While experimental data provide the most important handle on the conformational variability that the system is experiencing, they usually report on either time or ensemble averages. Since the available conformations largely outnumber the (independent) available experimental data, the latter can be equally well reproduced by a variety of ensembles. We have proposed the Maximum Occurrence (MaxOcc) approach to provide an upper bound of the statistical weight of each conformation. This method is expected to converge towards the true statistical weights by increasing the number of independent experimental datasets. In this paper we explore the ability of DEER (Double Electron Electron Resonance) data, which report on the distance distribution between two spin labels attached to a biomolecule, to restrain the MaxOcc values and its complementarity to previously introduced experimental techniques such as NMR and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering. We here present the case of Ca2+ bound calmodulin (CaM) as a test case and show that DEER data impose a sizeable reduction of the conformational space described by high MaxOcc conformations.},

abstract = {The prediction and design at the atomic level of membrane protein structures and interactions is a critical but unsolved challenge. To address this problem, we have developed an all-atom physical model that describes intraprotein and protein-solvent interactions in the membrane environment. We evaluated the ability of the model to recapitulate the energetics and structural specificities of polytopic membrane proteins by using a battery of in silico prediction and design tests. First, in side-chain packing and design tests, the model successfully predicts the side-chain conformations at 73% of nonexposed positions and the native amino acid identities at 34% of positions in naturally occurring membrane proteins. Second, the model predicts significant energy gaps between native and nonnative structures of transmembrane helical interfaces and polytopic membrane proteins. Third, distortions in transmembrane helices are successfully recapitulated in docking experiments by using fragments of ideal helices judiciously defined around helical kinks. Finally, de novo structure prediction reaches near-atomic accuracy (<2.5 {\AA}) for several small membrane protein domains (<150 residues). The success of the model highlights the critical role of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stability and structural specificity of membrane protein structures and sets the stage for the high-resolution prediction and design of complex membrane protein architectures. {\textcopyright}2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We explored network architectures incorporating related ideas and obtained the best performance with a 3-track network in which information at the 1D sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The 3-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables rapid solution of challenging X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate models of protein-protein complexes from sequence information alone, short circuiting traditional approaches which require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.

abstract = {The reliability of procedures for extracting the distance distribution between spins from the dipolar evolution function is studied with particular emphasis on broad distributions. A new numerically stable procedure for fitting distance distributions with polynomial interpolation between sampling points is introduced and compared to Tikhonov regularization in the dipolar frequency and distance domains and to approximate Pake transformation. Distance distributions with only narrow peaks are most reliably extracted by distance-domain Tikhonov regularization, while frequency-domain Tikhonov regularization is favorable for distributions with only broad peaks. For the quantification of distributions by their mean distance and variance, Hermite polynomial interpolation provides the best results. Distributions that contain both broad and narrow peaks are most difficult to analyze. In this case a high signal-to-noise ratio is strictly required and approximate Pake transformation should be applied. A procedure is given for renormalizing primary experimental data from protein preparations with slightly different degrees of spin labelling, so that they can be compared directly. Performance of all the data analysis procedures is demonstrated on experimental data for a shape-persistent biradical with a label-to-label distance of 5 nm, for a [2]catenane with a broad distance distribution, and for a doubly spin-labelled double mutant of plant light harvesting complex II.},

Analysis of an experimental DEER signal in terms of a distance distribution is a nontrivial task due to the ill-posed nature of the underlying mathematical inversion problem. This work introduces a Bayesian probabilistic inference approach to analyze DEER data, using a multi-Gauss mixture model for the distance distribution. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to determine a posterior probability distribution over model parameter space. This distribution contains all the information available from the data, including a full quantification of the uncertainty about the parameters. The corresponding uncertainty about the distance distribution is captured via an ensemble of posterior predictive distributions. Several synthetic examples illustrate the method. An experimental example shows the importance of model checking and comparison using residual analysis and Bayes factors. Overall, the Bayesian approach allows for more robust inference about protein conformations from DEER spectroscopy.},

In this sequence, an extra pulse at the pump frequency is used compared with standard four-pulse DEER. The position of the extra pulse is fixed relative to the three pulses of the detection sequence. This significantly reduces the effect of nuclear spin-diffusion on the electron-spin phase relaxation, thereby enabling longer dipolar evolution times that are required to measure longer distances. Using spin-labeled T4 lysozyme at a concentration less than 50 $\mu$M, as an example, we show that the evolution time increases by a factor of 1.8 in protonated solution and 1.4 in deuterated solution to 8 and 12 $\mu$s, respectively, with the potential to increase them further.

Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 {\AA}resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins, implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.},

abstract = {More than 80 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the SLC6A8 creatine transporter (hCRT1) are responsible for cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome (CCDS), which gives rise to a spectrum of neurological defects, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder. To gain insight into the nature of the molecular defects caused by these mutations, we quantitatively profiled the cellular processing, trafficking, expression, and function of eight pathogenic CCDS variants in relation to the wild type (WT) and one neutral isoform. All eight CCDS variants exhibit measurable proteostatic deficiencies that likely contribute to the observed LOF. However, the magnitudes of their specific effects on the expression and trafficking of hCRT1 vary considerably, and we find that the LOF associated with two of these variants primarily arises from the disruption of the substrate-binding pocket. In conjunction with an analysis of structural models of the transporter, we use these data to suggest mechanistic classifications for these variants. To evaluate potential avenues for therapeutic intervention, we assessed the sensitivity of these variants to temperature and measured their response to the proteostasis regulator 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). Only one of the tested variants (G132V) is sensitive to temperature, though its response to 4-PBA is negligible. Nevertheless, 4-PBA significantly enhances the activity of WT hCRT1 in HEK293T cells, which suggests it may be worth evaluating as a therapeutic for female intellectual disability patients carrying a single CCDS mutation. Together, these findings reveal that pathogenic SLC6A8 mutations cause a spectrum of molecular defects that should be taken into consideration in future efforts to develop CCDS therapeutics.},

However, determining their full conformational ensembles is extremely difficult because this requires detailed knowledge about the heterogeneity of the protein's degrees of freedom. Label-based experiments such as double electron-electron resonance (DEER) are very useful in studying flexible proteins, as they provide distributional data on heterogeneity. These experiments are typically performed separately, so information about correlation between distributions is lost. We have developed a method to recover correlation information using nonequilibrium work estimates in molecular dynamics refinement. We tested this method on a simple model of an alternating-access transporter for which the true joint distributions are known, and it successfully recovered the true joint distribution. We also applied our method to the protein syntaxin-1a, where it discarded physically implausible conformations. Our method thus provides a way to recover correlation structure in separate experimental measurements of conformational ensembles and refines the resulting structural ensemble.},

abstract = {The neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) belonging to the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) gene family (also referred to as the neurotransmitter-sodium- symporter family or Na +/Cl --dependent transporters) comprise a group of nine sodium- and chloride- dependent plasma membrane transporters for the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), dopamine, and norepinephrine, and the amino acid neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. The SLC6 NTTs are widely expressed in the mammalian brain and play an essential role in regulating neurotransmitter signaling and homeostasis by mediating uptake of released neurotransmitters from the extracellular space into neurons and glial cells. The transporters are targets for a wide range of therapeutic drugs used in treatment of psychiatric diseases, including major depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy. Furthermore, psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines have the SLC6 NTTs as primary targets. Beginning with the determination of a high-resolution structure of a prokaryotic homolog of the mammalian SLC6 transporters in 2005, the understanding of the molecular structure, function, and pharmacology of these proteins has advanced rapidly. Furthermore, intensive efforts have been directed toward understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in regulation of the activity of this important class of transporters, leading to new methodological developments and important insights. This review provides an update of these advances and their implications for the current understanding of the SLC6 NTTs. {\textcopyright}2011 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.},

In this study, the applicability of LIP to loop prediction in the framework of homology modelling is investigated. Searching the database for loop candidates takes less than 1 s on a desktop PC, and ranking them takes a few minutes. This is an order of magnitude faster than most existing procedures. The measure of accuracy is the root mean square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the main-chain atoms after local superposition of target loop and predicted loop. Loops of up to nine residues length were modelled with a local RMSD <1 {\AA}and those of length up to 14 residues with an accuracy better than 2 {\AA}. The results were compared in detail with a thoroughly evaluated and tested ab initio method published recently and additionally with two further methods for a small loop test set.

A growing body of evidence suggests a major role for interactions between TM domains of these receptors in signaling, through homo and heteromeric associations, conformational changes, assembly of signaling platforms, etc. Significantly, mutations within single domains are frequent in human disease, such as cancer or developmental disorders. This review attempts to give an overview of current knowledge about these interactions, from structural data to therapeutic perspectives, focusing on bitopic proteins involved in cell signaling. {\textcopyright}2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Trehalose has been recently promoted as efficient immobilizer of biomolecules for room-temperature EPR studies, including distance measurements between attached nitroxide spin labels. Generally, the structure of nitroxide influences the electron spin relaxation times, being crucial parameters for room-temperature pulse EPR measurements. Therefore, in this work we investigated a series of nitroxides with different substituents adjacent to NO-moiety including spirocyclohexane, spirocyclopentane, tetraethyl and tetramethyl groups. Electron spin relaxation times (T1, Tm) of these radicals immobilized in trehalose were measured at room temperature at X- and Q-bands (9/34 GHz). In addition, a comparison was made with the corresponding relaxation times in nitroxide-labeled DNA immobilized in trehalose. In all cases phase memory times Tm were close to 700 ns and did not essentially depend on structure of substituents. Comparison of temperature dependences of Tm at T = 80-300 K shows that the benefit of spirocyclohexane substituents well-known at medium temperatures (â¼100-180 K) becomes negligible at 300 K. Therefore, unless there are specific interactions between spin labels and biomolecules, the room-temperature value of Tm in trehalose is weakly dependent on the structure of substituents adjacent to NO-moiety of nitroxide. The issues of specific interactions and stability of nitroxide labels in biological media might be more important for room temperature pulsed dipolar EPR than differences in intrinsic spin relaxation of radicals.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter sodium symporters are integral membrane proteins that remove chemical transmitters from the synapse and terminate neurotransmission mediated by serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glycine and GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid). Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances. {\textcopyright}2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Modern pulse EPR experiments are routinely used to study the structural features of paramagnetic centers. They are usually performed at low temperatures, where relaxation times are long and polarization is high, to achieve a sufficient Signal/Noise Ratio (SNR). However, when working with samples whose amount and/or concentration are limited, sensitivity becomes an issue and therefore measurements may require a significant accumulation time, up to 12 h or more. As the detection scheme of practically all pulse EPR sequences is based on the integration of a spin echo - either primary, stimulated or refocused - a considerable increase in SNR can be obtained by replacing the single echo detection scheme by a train of echoes. All these echoes, generated by Carr-Purcell type sequences, are integrated and summed together to improve the SNR. This scheme is commonly used in NMR and here we demonstrate its applicability to a number of frequently used pulse EPR experiments: Echo-Detected EPR, Davies and Mims ENDOR (Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance), DEER (Electron-Electron Double Resonance|) and EDNMR (Electron-Electron Double Resonance (ELDOR)-Detected NMR), which were combined with a Carr-Purcell- Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) type detection scheme at W-band. By collecting the transient signal and integrating a number of refocused echoes, this detection scheme yielded a 1.6-5 folds SNR improvement, depending on the paramagnetic center and the pulse sequence applied. This improvement is achieved while keeping the experimental time constant and it does not introduce signal distortion. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins are critical functional molecules in the human body, constituting more than 30% of open reading frames in the human genome. Unfortunately, a myriad of difficulties in overexpression and reconstitution into membrane mimetics severely limit our ability to determine their structures. Computational tools are therefore instrumental to membrane protein structure prediction, consequently increasing our understanding of membrane protein function and their role in disease. Here, we describe a general framework facilitating membrane protein modeling and design that combines the scientific principles for membrane protein modeling with the flexible software architecture of Rosetta3. This new framework, called RosettaMP, provides a general membrane representation that interfaces with scoring, conformational sampling, and mutation routines that can be easily combined to create new protocols. To demonstrate the capabilities of this implementation, we developed four proof-of-concept applications for (1) prediction of free energy changes upon mutation; (2) high-resolution structural refinement; (3) protein-protein docking; and (4) assembly of symmetric protein complexes, all in the membrane environment. Preliminary data show that these algorithms can produce meaningful scores and structures. The data also suggest needed improvements to both sampling routines and score functions. Importantly, the applications collectively demonstrate the potential of combining the flexible nature of RosettaMP with the power of Rosetta algorithms to facilitate membrane protein modeling and design.},

abstract = {The modeling of protein-protein complexes greatly benefits from the incorporation of experimental distance restraints. Pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy is one such powerful technique for obtaining long-range distance restraints in protein complexes. Measurements of the dipolar interaction between two spins placed specifically within a protein complex give information about the spin-spin separation distance. We have developed a convenient method to incorporate such long-range distance information in the modeling of protein-protein complexes that is based on rigid body refinement of the protein components with the software Crystallography and NMR System (CNS). Factors affecting convergence such as number of restraints, error allocation scheme, and number and position of spin labeling sites were investigated with real and simulated data. The use of 4 to 5 different labeling sites on each protein component was found to provide sufficient coverage for producing accuracies limited by the uncertainty in the spin-label conformation within the complex. With an asymmetric scheme of allocating this uncertainty, addition of simulated restraints revealed the importance of longer distances within a limited set of total restraints. We present two case studies: (1) refinement of the complex formed between the histidine kinase CheA and its coupling protein CheW, and (2) refinement of intra-helical separations in the protein a-synuclein bound to micelles. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Inc.

Site-directed spin-labeling using (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5- tetramethyl-3-pyrrolin-3-yl)methyl methanethiosulfonate was performed with a R64C mutant of the protein. The orientations of the spin-labels in the tetramer were determined by PELDOR experiments performed at two magnetic field strengths (0.3 T/X-band and 1.2 T/Q-band) and variable probe frequency. Quantitative simulation of the PELDOR data supports a strongly restricted nitroxide, oriented at an angle of 65Â° relative to the central channel axis. In general, poorer quality PELDOR data were obtained from membrane-reconstituted preparations compared to soluble proteins or detergent-solubilized samples. One reason for this is the reduced transverse spin relaxation time T2 of nitroxides due to crowding of tetramers within the membrane that occurs even at low protein to lipid ratios. This reduced T2 can be overcome by reconstituting mixtures of unlabeled and labeled proteins, yielding high-quality PELDOR data. Identical PELDOR oscillation frequencies and their dependencies on the probe frequency were observed in the detergent and membrane-reconstituted preparations, indicating that the position and orientation of the spin-labels are the same in both environments. {\textcopyright}2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {X-ray crystal structures have revealed that numerous secondary transporter proteins originally categorized into different sequence families share similar structures, namely, the LeuT fold. The core of this fold consists of two units of five transmembrane helices, whose conformations have been proposed to exchange to form the two alternate states required for transport. That these two units are related implies that LeuT-like transporters evolved from gene-duplication and fusion events. Thus, the origins of this structural repeat may be relevant to the evolution of transport function. However, the lack of significant sequence similarity requires sensitive sequence search methods for analyzing their evolution. To this end, we developed a software application called AlignMe, which can use various types of input information, such as residue hydrophobicity, to perform pairwise alignments of sequences and/or of hydropathy profiles of (membrane) proteins. We used AlignMe to analyze the evolutionary relationships between repeats of the LeuT fold. In addition, we identified proteins from the so-called DedA family that potentially share a common ancestor with these repeats. DedA domains have been implicated in, e.g., selenite uptake; they are found widely distributed across all kingdoms of life; two or more DedA domains are typically found per genome, and some may adopt dual topologies. These results suggest that DedA proteins existed in ancient organisms and may function as dimers, as required for a would-be ancestor of the LeuT fold. In conclusion, we provide novel insights into the evolution of this important structural motif and thus potentially into the alternating-access mechanism of transport itself. {\textcopyright}2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Background: Various forms of the so-called loop closure problem are crucial to protein structure prediction methods. Given an N- and a C-terminal end, the problem consists of finding a suitable segment of a certain length that bridges the ends seamlessly. In homology modelling, the problem arises in predicting loop regions. In de novo protein structure prediction, the problem is encountered when implementing local moves for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Most loop closure algorithms keep the bond angles fixed or semi-fixed, and only vary the dihedral angles. This is appropriate for a full-atom protein backbone, since the bond angles can be considered as fixed, while the ($\phi$, $\psi$) dihedral angles are variable. However, many de novo structure prediction methods use protein models that only consist of C $\alpha$ atoms, or otherwise do not make use of all backbone atoms. These methods require a method that alters both bond and dihedral angles, since the pseudo bond angle between three consecutive C $\alpha$ atoms also varies considerably. Results: Here we present a method that solves the loop closure problem for C $\alpha$ only protein models. We developed a variant of Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), an inverse kinematics method from the field of robotics, which was recently applied to the loop closure problem. Since the method alters both bond and dihedral angles, which is equivalent to applying a full rotation matrix, we call our method Full CCD (FCDD). FCCD replaces CCD's vector-based optimization of a rotation around an axis with a singular value decomposition-based optimization of a general rotation matrix. The method is easy to implement and numerically stable. Conclusion: We tested the method's performance on sets of random protein C$\alpha$ segments between 5 and 30 amino acids long, and a number of loops of length 4, 8 and 12. FCCD is fast, has a high success rate and readily generates conformations close to those of real loops. The presence of constraints on the angles only has a small effect on the performance. A reference implementation of FCCD in Python is available as supplementary information. {\textcopyright}2005 Boomsma and Hamelryck; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Molecular dynamics simulations show that extracellular Na+ is blocked unless Leu25 is rotated out of the substrate-binding pocket.

This C-H bond oxy-functionalization activity has huge potential in biotechnological applications. Class I CYPs receive the two electrons required for oxygen activation from NAD(P)H via a ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. The interaction of Class I CYPs with their cognate ferredoxin is specific. In order to reconstitute the activity of diverse CYPs, structural characterization of CYP-ferredoxin complexes is necessary, but little structural information is available. Here we report a structural model of such a complex (CYP199A2-HaPux) in frozen solution derived from distance and orientation restraints gathered by the EPR technique of orientation-selective double electron-electron resonance (os-DEER). The long-lived oscillations in the os-DEER spectra were well modeled by a single orientation of the CYP199A2-HaPux complex. The structure is different from the two known Class I CYP-Fdx structures: CYP11A1-Adx and CYP101A1-Pdx. At the protein interface, HaPux residues in the [Fe2S2] cluster-binding loop and the $\alpha$3 helix and the C-terminus residue interact with CYP199A2 residues in the proximal loop and the C helix. These residue contacts are consistent with biochemical data on CYP199A2-ferredoxin binding and electron transfer. Electron-tunneling calculations indicate an efficient electron-transfer pathway from the [Fe2S2] cluster to the heme. This new structural model of a CYP-Fdx complex provides the basis for tailoring CYP enzymes for which the cognate ferredoxin is not known, to accept electrons from HaPux and display monooxygenase activity.},

Once set in motion, these molecular changes weaken substrate binding to the transporter and allow galactose readily to enter the intracellular space. Additionally, we identify an allosteric pathway between the sodium-binding sites, the unwound portion of transmembrane helix 1 and the substrate-binding site that is essential in the coupling of co-transport. {\textcopyright}2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Two of the four underrepresented sequences (URSs) were shown to interfere with translation in vivo and in vitro. Enlarging the URS by a single amino acid resulted in increased translational inhibition. Single-molecule methods revealed stalling of translation at the entrance of the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome, adjacent to ribosomal nucleotides A2062 and U2585. Interaction with these same ribosomal residues is involved in regulation of translation by longer, naturally occurring protein sequences. The E. coli exit tunnel has evidently evolved to minimize interaction with the exit tunnel and maximize the sequence diversity of the proteome, although allowing some interactions for regulatory purposes. Bioinformatic analysis of the human proteome revealed no underrepresented triplet sequences, possibly reflecting an absence of regulation by interaction with the exit tunnel.},

abstract = {The flexibility of biological macromolecules is an important structural determinant of function. Unfortunately, the correlations between different motional modes are poorly captured by discrete ensemble representations. Here, we present new ways to both represent and visualize correlated interdomain motions. Interdomain motions are determined directly from residual dipolar couplings, represented as a continuous conformational distribution, and visualized using the disk-on-sphere representation. Using the disk-on-sphere representation, features of interdomain motions, including correlations, are intuitively visualized. The representation works especially well for multidomain systems with broad conformational distributions.This analysis also can be extended to multiple probability density modes, using a Bingham mixture model. We use this new paradigm to study the interdomain motions of staphylococcal protein A, which is a key virulence factor contributing to the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus. We capture the smooth transitions between important states and demonstrate the utility of continuous distribution functions for computing the reorientational components of binding thermodynamics. Such insights allow for the dissection of the dynamic structural components of functionally important intermolecular interactions.},

The secondary, super-secondary and domain structures of the pyridoxal-phosphate holoenzyme at pH 7.5 are described in detail. The surface area of the interface between the monomer subunits of this dimeric $\alpha$2 protein is unusually large, indicating a very stable dimer. This is consistent with biochemical data. Both subunit and domain interfaces are relatively smooth compared with other proteins. The interactions of the protein with its co-factor are described and compared among the three structures. Observed changes in co-factor conformation may be related to spectral changes and the energetics of the catalytic reaction. Small but significant adjustments of the protein to changes in co-factor conformation are seen. These adjustments may be accommodated by small rigid-body shifts of secondary structural elements, and by packing defects in the protein core. {\textcopyright}1992.},

During the experiment we predicted the structure of eleven unpublished antibody Fv fragments. Our prediction methods centered on template-based modeling; potential templates were selected from an antibody database based on their sequence similarity to the target in the framework regions. Depending on the quality of the templates, we constructed models of the antibody framework regions either using a single, chimeric or multiple template approach. The hypervariable loop regions in the initial models were rebuilt by grafting the corresponding regions from suitable templates onto the model. For the H3 loop region, we further refined models using ab initio methods. The final models were subjected to constrained energy minimization to resolve severe local structural problems. The analysis of the models submitted show that Accelrys tools allow for the construction of quite accurate models for the framework and the canonical CDR regions, with RMSDs to the X-ray structure on average below 1 {\AA}for most of these regions. The results show that accurate prediction of the H3 hypervariable loops remains a challenge. Furthermore, model quality assessment of the submitted models show that the models are of quite high quality, with local geometry assessment scores similar to that of the target X-ray structures. {\textcopyright}2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL:Fold.

abstract = {Covalent labeling mass spectrometry experiments are growing in popularity and provide important information regarding protein structure. Information obtained from these experiments correlates with residue solvent exposure within the protein in solution. However, it is impossible to determine protein structure from covalent labeling data alone. Incorporation of sparse covalent labeling data into the protein structure prediction software Rosetta has been shown to improve protein tertiary structure prediction. Here, covalent labeling techniques were analyzed computationally to provide insight into what labeling data is needed to optimize tertiary protein structure prediction in Rosetta. We have successfully implemented a new scoring functionality that provides improved predictions. We developed two new covalent labeling based score terms that use a "cone"-based neighbor count to quantify the relative solvent exposure of each amino acid. To test our method, we used a set of 20 proteins with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Decoy model sets were generated for each of these 20 proteins, and the normalized covalent labeling score versus RMSD distributions were evaluated. On the basis of these distributions, we have determined an optimal subset of residues to use when performing covalent labeling experiments in order to maximize the structure prediction capabilities of the covalent labeling data. We also investigated how much false negative and false positive data can be tolerated without meaningfully impacting protein structure prediction. Using these new covalent labeling score terms, protein models were rescored and the resulting models improved by 3.9 {\AA}RMSD on average. New models were also generated using Rosetta's AbinitioRelax program under the guidance of covalent labeling information, and improvement in model quality was observed.},

abstract = {A tether-in-a-cone model is developed for the simulation of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of dipolar coupled nitroxide spin labels attached to tethers statically disordered within cones of variable halfwidth. In this model, the nitroxides adopt a range of interprobe distances and orientations. The aim is to develop tools for determining both the distance distribution and the relative orientation of the labels from experimental spectra. Simulations demonstrate the sensitivity of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra to the orientation of the cones as a function of cone halfwidth and other parameters. For small cone halfwidths (<â¼40Â°), simulated spectra are strongly dependent on the relative orientation of the cones. For larger cone halfwidths, spectra become independent of cone orientation. Tether-in-a-cone model simulations are analyzed using a convolution approach based on Fourier transforms. Spectra obtained by the Fourier convolution method more closely fit the tether-in-a-cone simulations as the halfwidth of the cone increases. The Fourier convolution method gives a reasonable estimate of the correct average distance, though the distance distribution obtained can be significantly distorted. Finally, the tether-in-a-cone model is successfully used to analyze experimental spectra from T4 lysozyme. These results demonstrate the utility of the model and highlight directions for further development. {\textcopyright}2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The relationship between DNA sequence recognition and catalytic specificity in a DNA-modifying enzyme was explored using paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions as probes for ESR spectroscopic and biochemical studies. Electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy establishes that Cu 2+ coordinates to histidine residues in the EcoRI endonuclease homodimer bound to its specific DNA recognition site. The coordinated His residues were identified by a unique use of Cu 2+-ion based long-range distance constraints. Double electron- electron resonance data yield Cu 2+-Cu 2+ and Cu 2+-nitroxide distances that are uniquely consistent with one Cu 2+ bound to His114 in each subunit. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirms that two Cu 2+ ions bind per complex. Unexpectedly, Mg 2+-catalyzed DNA cleavage by EcoRI is profoundly inhibited by Cu 2+ binding at these hitherto unknown sites, 13 {\AA}away from the Mg 2+positions in the catalytic centers. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a model for inhibition of catalysis, whereby the Cu 2+ ions alter critical protein-DNA interactions and water molecule positions in the catalytic sites. In the absence of Cu 2+, the Mg 2+-dependence of EcoRI catalysis shows positive cooperativity, which would enhance EcoRI inactivation of foreign DNA by irreparable doublestrand cuts, in preference to readily repaired single-strand nicks. Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations suggest that this cooperativity arises because the binding of Mg 2+ in one catalytic site makes the surface electrostatic potential in the distal catalytic site more negative, thus enhancing binding of the second Mg 2+. Taken together, our results shed light on the structural and electrostatic factors that affect site-specific catalysis by this class of endonucleases.},

abstract = {Measurement of distances between spin labels using electron paramagnetic resonance with the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique is an important method for evaluation of biomolecular structures. Computation of interlabel distances is of value for experimental planning, validation of known structures using DEER-measured distances, and determination of theoretical data for comparison with experiment. This requires steps of building labels at two defined sites on proteins, DNA or RNA; calculation of allowable label conformers based on rotation around torsional angles; computation of pairwise interlabel distances on a per conformer basis; and calculation of an average distance between the two label ensembles. We have described and validated two programs for this purpose: NASNOX, which permits computation of distances between R5 labels on DNA or RNA; and PRONOX, which similarly computes distances between R1 labels on proteins. However, these programs are limited to a specific single label and single target types. Therefore, we have developed a program, which we refer to as ALLNOX (Addition of Labels and Linkers), which permits addition of any label to any site on any target. The main principle in the program is to break the molecular system into a "label," a "linker," and a "target." The user can upload a "label" with any chemistry, define a "linker" based on a SMILES-like string, and then define the "target" site. The flexibility of ALLNOX facilitates theoretical evaluation of labels prior to synthesis and accommodates evaluation of experimental data in biochemical complexes containing multiple molecular types.},

abstract = {Sertraline and fluoxetine are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that are widely prescribed to treat depression. They exert their effects by inhibiting the presynaptic plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT). All SSRIs possess halogen atoms at specific positions, which are key determinants for the drugs' specificity for SERT. For the SERT protein, however, the structural basis of its specificity for SSRIs is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structures of LeuT, a bacterial SERT homolog, in complex with sertraline, R-fluoxetine or S-fluoxetine. The SSRI halogens all bind to exactly the same pocket within LeuT. Mutation at this halogen-binding pocket (HBP) in SERT markedly reduces the transporter's affinity for SSRIs but not for tricyclic antidepressants. Conversely, when the only nonconserved HBP residue in both norepinephrine and dopamine transporters is mutated into that found in SERT, their affinities for all the three SSRIs increase uniformly. Thus, the specificity of SERT for SSRIs is dependent largely on interaction of the drug halogens with the protein's HBP. {\textcopyright}2009 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to obtain details on the distribution and average structure and locations of membrane-associated peptides. The approach combines (i) pulse double electron-electron resonance (DEER) to determine intramolecular distances between residues in spin labeled peptides, (ii) electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments to measure water exposure and the direct interaction of spin labeled peptides with deuterium nuclei on the phospholipid molecules, and (iii) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to derive the peptide-membrane populations, energetics, and average conformation of the native peptide and mutants mimicking the spin labeling. To demonstrate the approach, we investigated the membrane-bound and solution state of the well-known antimicrobial peptide melittin, used as a model system. A good agreement was obtained between the experimental results and the MC simulations regarding the distribution of distances between the labeled amino acids, the side chain mobility, and the peptide's orientation. A good agreement in the extent of membrane penetration of amino acids in the peptide core was obtained as well, but the EPR data reported a somewhat deeper membrane penetration of the termini compared to the simulations. Overall, melittin adsorbed on the membrane surface, in a monomelic state, as an amphipatic helix with its hydrophobic residues in the hydrocarbon region of the membrane and its charged and polar residues in the lipid headgroup region. {\textcopyright}2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters actively move chemically diverse substrates across biological membranes. Their malfunction leads to human diseases. Many ABC exporters encompass asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs), and some of them are inhibited by the transported substrate. The functional relevance of the catalytic asymmetry or the mechanism for trans-inhibition remains elusive. Here, we investigated TmrAB, a functional homologue of the human antigen translocation complex TAP using advanced electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy. In the presence of ATP, the heterodimeric ABC exporter exists in a tunable equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing conformations. The two NBSs exhibit pronounced asymmetry in the open-to-close equilibrium. The closed conformation is more favored at the degenerate NBS, and closure of either of the NBS is sufficient to open the extracellular gate. We define the mechanistic basis for trans-inhibition, which operates by a reverse transition from the outward-facing state through an occluded conformation. These novel findings uncover the central role of reversible conformational equilibrium in the function and regulation of an ABC exporter and establish a mechanistic framework for future investigations on other medically important transporters with imprinted asymmetry. Also, this study demonstrates for the first-time the feasibility to resolve equilibrium populations at multiple domains and their interdependence for global conformational changes in a large membrane protein complex.},

abstract = {Membrane-protein design is an exciting and increasingly successful research area which has led to landmarks including the design of stable and accurate membrane-integral proteins based on coiled-coil motifs. Design of topologically more complex proteins, such as most receptors, channels, and transporters, however, demands an energy function that balances contributions from intra-protein contacts and protein-membrane interactions. Recent advances in water-soluble all-atom energy functions have increased the accuracy in structure-prediction benchmarks. The plasma membrane, however, imposes different physical constraints on protein solvation. To understand these constraints, we recently developed a high-throughput experimental screen, called dsT$\beta$L, and inferred apparent insertion energies for each amino acid at dozens of positions across the bacterial plasma membrane. Here, we express these profiles as lipophilicity energy terms in Rosetta and demonstrate that the new energy function outperforms previous ones in modelling and design benchmarks. Rosetta ab initio simulations starting from an extended chain recapitulate two-thirds of the experimentally determined structures of membrane-spanning homo-oligomers with <2.5{\AA}root-mean-square deviation within the top-predicted five models (available online: http://tmhop.weizmann.ac.il). Furthermore, in two sequence-design benchmarks, the energy function improves discrimination of stabilizing point mutations and recapitulates natural membrane-protein sequences of known structure, thereby recommending this new energy function for membrane-protein modelling and design.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance using site-directed spin labeling can be used as an approach for determination of protein structures that are difficult to solve by other methods. One important aspect of this approach is the measurement of interlabel distances using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) method. Interpretation of experimental data could be facilitated by a computational approach to calculation of interlabel distances. We describe an algorithm, PRONOX, for rapid computation of interlabel distances based on calculation of spin label conformer distributions at any site of a protein. The program incorporates features of the label distribution established experimentally, including weighting of favorable conformers of the label. Distances calculated by PRONOX were compared with new DEER distances for amphiphysin and annexin B12 and with published data for FCHo2 (F-BAR), endophilin, and $\alpha$-synuclein, a total of 44 interlabel distances. The program reproduced these distances accurately (r 2 = 0.94, slope = 0.98). For 9 of the 11 distances for amphiphysin, PRONOX reproduced the experimental data to within 2.5 {\AA}. The speed and accuracy of PRONOX suggest that the algorithm can be used for fitting to DEER data for determination of protein tertiary structure.

The method employs a high-coordination lattice representation of the protein chain that incorporates a variety of potentials designed to produce protein-like behaviour. These include statistical preferences for secondary structure, side-chain burial interactions, and a hydrogen-bond potential. Using this algorithm, several globular proteins (1ctf, 2gbl, 2trx, 3fxn, 1mba, 1pcy and 6pti) have been folded to moderate-resolution, native-like compact states. For example, the 68 residue 1ctf molecule having ten loosely defined, long-range restraints was reproducibly obtained with a C($\alpha$)-backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from native of about 4. {\AA}. Flavodoxin with 35 restraints has been folded to structures whose average RMSD is 4.28 {\AA}. Furthermore, using just 20 restraints, myoglobin, which is a 146 residue helical protein, has been folded to structures whose average RMSD from native is 5.65 {\AA}. Plastocyanin with 25 long-range restraints adopts conformations whose average RMSD is 5.44 {\AA}. Possible applications of the proposed approach to the refinement of structures from NMR data, homology model-building and the determination of tertiary structure when the secondary structure and a small number of restraints are predicted are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein loop conformations without any prior knowledge (ab initio prediction) is an unsolved problem. Its solution will significantly impact protein homology and template-based modeling as well as ab initio protein-structure prediction. Here, we developed a coarse-grained, optimized scoring function for initial sampling and ranking of loop decoys. The resulting decoys are then further optimized in backbone and side-chain conformations and ranked by all-atom energy scoring functions. The final integrated technique called loop prediction by energy-assisted protocol achieved a median value of 2.1 {\AA}root mean square deviation (RMSD) for 325 12-residue test loops and 2.0 {\AA}RMSD for 45 12-residue loops from critical assessment of structure-prediction techniques (CASP) 10 target proteins with native core structures (backbone and side chains). If all side-chain conformations in protein cores were predicted in the absence of the target loop, loop-prediction accuracy only reduces slightly (0.2 {\AA}difference in RMSD for 12-residue loops in the CASP target proteins). The accuracy obtained is about 1 {\AA}RMSD or more improvement over other methods we tested.

In those methods the typical situation is that there is a high ratio between the numbers of objects and variables in the regression problems solved. Furthermore, very similar regression problems are solved many times during the iterative procedures used. The algorithm proposed is based on the de facto standard algorithm NNLS by Lawson and Hanson, but modified to take advantage of the special characteristics of iterative algorithms involving repeated use of non-negativity constraints.

abstract = {LeuT serves as the model protein for understanding the relationships between structure, mechanism and pharmacology in neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSSs). At the present time, however, there is a vigorous debate over whether there is a single high-affinity substrate site (S1) located at the original, crystallographically determined substrate site or whether there are two high-affinity substrates sites, one at the primary or S1 site and the other at a second site (S2) located at the base of the extracellular vestibule. In an effort to address the controversy over the number of high-affinity substrate sites in LeuT, one group studied the F253A mutant of LeuT and asserted that in this mutant substrate binds exclusively to the S2 site and that 1 mM clomipramine entirely ablates substrate binding to the S2 site. Here we study the binding of substrate to the F253A mutant of LeuT using ligand binding and X-ray crystallographic methods. Both experimental methods unambiguously show that substrate binds to the S1 site of the F253A mutant and that binding is retained in the presence of 1 mM clomipramine. These studies, in combination with previous work, are consistent with a mechanism for LeuT that involves a single high-affinity substrate binding site. {\textcopyright}2012 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {Sodium-coupled substrate transport plays a central role in many biological processes. However, despite knowledge of the structures of several sodium-coupled transporters, the location of the sodiumbinding site(s) often remains unclear. Several of these structures have the five transmembrane-helix inverted-topology repeat, LeuTlike (FIRL) fold, whose pseudosymmetry has been proposed to facilitate the alternating-access mechanism required for transport. Here, we provide biophysical, biochemical, and computational evidence for the location of the two cation-binding sites in the sodium-coupled betaine symporter BetP. A recent X-ray structure of BetP in a sodium-bound closed state revealed that one of these sites, equivalent to the Na2 site in related transporters, is located between transmembrane helices 1 and 8 of the FIRL-fold; here, we confirm the location of this site by other means. Based on the pseudosymmetry of this fold, we hypothesized that the second site is located between the equivalent helices 6 and 3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the closed-state structure suggest this second sodium site involves two threonine sidechains and a backbone carbonyl from helix 3, a phenylalanine from helix 6, and a water molecule. Mutating the residues proposed to form the two binding sites increased the apparent Km and Kd for sodium, as measured by betaine uptake, tryptophan fluorescence, and 22Na+ binding, and also diminished the transient currents measured in proteoliposomes using solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for the identity of the residues forming the sodium-binding sites in BetP.},

abstract = {Protein loop modeling is a tool for predicting protein local structures of particular interest, providing opportunities for applications involving protein structure prediction and de novo protein design. Until recently, themajority of loopmodelingmethods have been developed and tested by reconstructing loops in frameworks of experimentally resolved structures. In many practical applications, however, the protein loops to be modeled are located in inaccurate structural environments. These include loops in model structures, low-resolution experimental structures, or experimental structures of different functional forms. Accordingly, discrepancies in the accuracy of the structural environment assumed in development of the method and that in practical applications present additional challenges to modern loop modeling methods. This study demonstrates a new strategy for employing a hybrid energy function combining physics-based and knowledge-based components to help tackle this challenge. The hybrid energy function is designed to combine the strengths of each energy component, simultaneously maintaining accurate loop structure prediction in a highresolution framework structure and tolerating minor environmental errors in lowresolution structures. A loop modeling method based on global optimization of this new energy function is tested on loop targets situated in different levels of environmental errors, ranging from experimental structures to structures perturbed in backbone as well as side chains and template-based model structures. The new method performs comparably to force field-based approaches in loop reconstruction in crystal structures and better in loop prediction in inaccurate framework structures. This result suggests that higher-accuracy predictions would be possible for a broader range of applications. The web server for this method is available at http://galaxy. seoklab.org/loop with the PS2 option for the scoring function.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining distance distributions between pairs of engineered nitroxide spin-labels in proteins and other biological macromolecules. These measurements require the use of cryogenic temperatures (77 K or less) to prolong the phase memory relaxation time (Tm) sufficiently to enable detection of a DEER echo curve. Generally, a cryoprotectant such as glycerol is added to protein samples to facilitate glass formation and avoid protein clustering (which can result in a large decrease in Tm) during relatively slow flash freezing in liquid N2. However, cryoprotectants are osmolytes and can influence protein folding/unfolding equilibria, as well as species populations in weak multimeric systems. Here we show that submillisecond rapid freezing, achieved by high velocity spraying of the sample onto a rapidly spinning, liquid nitrogen cooled copper disc obviates the requirement for cryoprotectants and permits high quality DEER data to be obtained in absence of glycerol. We demonstrate this approach on five different protein systems: protein A, the metastable drkN SH3 domain, urea-unfolded drkN SH3, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the transmembrane domain of HIV-1 gp41 in lipid bicelles.},

abstract = {Amino acid transport into the cell is often coupled to the proton electrochemical gradient, as found in the solute carrier 36 family of proton-coupled amino acid transporters. Although no structure of a human proton-coupled amino acid transporter exists, the crystal structure of a related homolog from bacteria, GkApcT, has recently been solved in an inward-occluded state and allows an opportunity to examine how protons are coupled to amino acid transport. Our working hypothesis is that release of the amino acid substrate is facilitated by the deprotonation of a key glutamate residue (E115) located at the bottom of the binding pocket, which forms part of the intracellular gate, allowing the protein to transition from an inward-occluded to an inward-open conformation. During unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we observed a transition from the inward-occluded state captured in the crystal structure to a much more open state, which we consider likely to be representative of the inward-open state associated with substrate release. To explore this and the role of protons in these transitions, we have used umbrella sampling to demonstrate that the transition from inward occluded to inward open is more energetically favorable when E115 is deprotonated. That E115 is likely to be protonated in the inward-occluded state and deprotonated in the inward-open state is further confirmed via the use of absolute binding free energies. Finally, we also show, via the use of absolute binding free energy calculations, that the affinity of the protein for alanine is very similar regardless of either the conformational state or the protonation of E115, presumably reflecting the fact that all the key interactions are deep within the binding cavity. Together, our results give a detailed picture of the role of protons in driving one of the major transitions in this transporter.},

abstract = {Sodium coupled cotransporters of the five-helix inverted repeat (5HIR) superfamily use an alternating access mechanism to transport a myriad of small molecules across the cell membrane. One of the primary steps in this mechanism is the conformational transition from a state poised to bind extracellular substrates to a state that is competent to deliver substrate to the cytoplasm. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the 5HIR benzylhydantoin transporter Mhp1 that incorporates experimental structures of the outward- and inward-open states to investigate the mechanism of this conformational change. Using the weighted ensemble path-sampling method, we rigorously sample the outward- to inward-facing transition path ensemble. The transition path ensemble reveals a heterogeneous set of pathways connecting the two states and identifies two modes of transport: one consistent with a strict alternating access mechanism and another where decoupling of the inner and outer gates causes the transient formation of a continuous permeation pathway through the transporter. We also show that the conformational switch between the outward- and inward-open states results from rigid body motions of the hash motif relative to the substrate bundle, supporting the rocking bundle hypothesis. Finally, our methodology provides the groundwork for more chemically detailed investigations of the alternating mechanism. {\textcopyright}2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {To reach the mammalian gut, enteric bacteria must pass through the stomach. Many such organisms survive exposure to the harsh gastric environment (pH 1.5-4) by mounting extreme acid-resistance responses, one of which, the arginine-dependent system of Escherichia coli, has been studied at levels of cellular physiology, molecular genetics and protein biochemistry. This multiprotein system keeps the cytoplasm above pH 5 during acid challenge by continually pumping protons out of the cell using the free energy of arginine decarboxylation. At the heart of the process is a virtual proton pump in the inner membrane, called AdiC, that imports l-arginine from the gastric juice and exports its decarboxylation product agmatine. AdiC belongs to the APC superfamily of membrane proteins, which transports amino acids, polyamines and organic cations in a multitude of biological roles, including delivery of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis, facilitation of insulin release from pancreatic Î-cells, and, when inappropriately overexpressed, provisioning of certain fast-growing neoplastic cells with amino acids. High-resolution structures and detailed transport mechanisms of APC transporters are currently unknown. Here we describe a crystal structure of AdiC at 3.2 resolution. The protein is captured in an outward-open, substrate-free conformation with transmembrane architecture remarkably similar to that seen in four other families of apparently unrelated transport proteins. {\textcopyright}2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To interpret the complex EPR spectra that often arise, it is necessary to characterize the rotamers of the spin-labeled side chain and the interactions they make with the local environment in proteins of known structure. For this purpose, crystal structures have been determined for T4 lysozyme bearing a nitroxide side chain (R1) at the solvent-exposed helical sites 41 and 44 in the B helix. These sites are of particular interest in that the corresponding EPR spectra reveal two dynamic states of R1, one of which is relatively immobilized suggesting interactions of the nitroxide with the environment. The crystal structures together with the effect of mutagenesis of nearest neighbors on the motion of R1 suggest intrahelical interactions of 41R1 with the i + 4 residue and of 44R1 with the i + 1 residue. Such interactions appear to be specific to particular rotamers of the R1 side chain.},

abstract = {The biologically active state of many proteins requires their prior homo-oligomerisation. Such complexes are typically symmetrical, a feature that has been proposed to increase their stability and facilitate the evolution of allosteric regulation. We wished to examine the possibility that similar structures and properties could arise from genetic amplifications leading to internal symmetrical repeats. For this, we identified internal structural repeats in a nonredundant Protein Data Bank subset. While testing if repeats in proteins tend to be symmetrical, we found that about half of the large internal repeats are symmetrical, most frequently around a rotation axis of 180Â°. These repeats were most likely created by genetic amplification processes because they show significant sequence similarity. Symmetrical repeats tend to have a fixed number of copies corresponding to their rotational symmetry order, that is, two for 180Â° rotation axis, whereas asymmetrical repeats are in longer proteins and show copy number variability. When possible, we confirmed that proteins with symmetrical repeats folding as an n-mer have homologues lacking the repeat with a higher oligomerisation number corresponding to the rotation symmetry order of the repeat. Phylogenetic analyses of these protein families suggest that typically, but not always, symmetrical repeats arise in one single event from proteins that are homo-oligomers. These results suggest that oligomerisation and amplification of internal sequences can interplay in evolutionary terms because they result in functional analogues when the latter exhibit rotational symmetry. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The predicted conformational change, which is a linear combination of multiple low-frequency normal modes that are solved from the elastic network model, is computed as a response displacement induced by a perturbation to the system Hamiltonian that incorporates the given distance constraints. For a list of test cases, we find that the computed response displacement overlaps significantly with the measured conformational changes, when only a handful of pairwise constraints are used (â¤10). The performance of this method is also shown to be robust against different choices of pairwise distance constraints and errors in their values.

Although principal mechanistic elements of proton/substrate antiport have been described, the structural record is limited to the conformation of the substrate-bound state, which has been shown to undergo isoenergetic alternating access. A central but missing link in the structure/mechanism relationship is a description of the protonbound state, which is an obligatory intermediate in the transport cycle. Here we report a systematic spin labeling and double electron electron resonance (DEER) study that uncovers the conformational changes of EmrE subsequent to protonation of critical acidic residues in the context of a global description of ligand-induced structural rearrangements. We find that protonation of E14 leads to extensive rotation and tilt of transmembrane helices 1-3 in conjunction with repacking of loops, conformational changes that alter the coordination of the bound substrate and modulate its access to the binding site from the lipid bilayer. The transport model that emerges from our data posits a proton-bound, but occluded, resting state. Substrate binding from the inner leaflet of the bilayer releases the protons and triggers alternating access between inward-And outward-facing conformations of the substrate-loaded transporter, thus enabling antiport without dissipation of the proton gradient.},

abstract = {More than two decades ago, the activation mechanism for the membrane-bound photoreceptor and prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin was uncovered. Upon light-induced changes in ligandâreceptor interaction, movement of specific transmembrane helices within the receptor opens a crevice at the cytoplasmic surface, allowing for coupling of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). The general features of this activation mechanism are conserved across the GPCR superfamily. Nevertheless, GPCRs have selectivity for distinct G-protein family members, but the mechanism of selectivity remains elusive. Structures of GPCRs in complex with the stimulatory G protein, Gs, and an accessory nanobody to stabilize the complex have been reported, providing information on the intermolecular interactions. However, to reveal the structural selectivity filters, it will be necessary to determine GPCRâG protein structures involving other G-protein subtypes. In addition, it is important to obtain structures in the absence of a nanobody that may influence the structure. Here, we present a model for a rhodopsinâG protein complex derived from intermolecular distance constraints between the activated receptor and the inhibitory G protein, Gi, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and spin-labeling methodologies. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the overall stability of the modeled complex. In the rhodopsinâGi complex, Gi engages rhodopsin in a manner distinct from previous GPCRâGs structures, providing insight into specificity determinants.},

Crystal structures of V1 at two positions in a helix of T4 Lysozyme and quantum mechanical calculations suggest the source of the constraints as intra-side chain interactions of the disulfide sulfur atoms with both the protein backbone and the 3-nitrogen in the imidazoline ring. These interactions apparently limit the conformation of the side chain to one of only three possible rotamers, two of which are observed in the crystal structure. An inter-spin distance measurement in frozen solution using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) gives a value essentially identical to that determined from the crystal structure of the protein containing two copies of V1, indicating that lattice forces do not dictate the rotamers observed. Collectively, the results suggest the possibility of predetermining a unique rotamer of V1 in helical structures. In general, the reduced rotameric space of V1 compared to R1 should simplify interpretation of inter-spin distance information in terms of protein structure, while the highly constrained internal motion is expected to extend the dynamic range for characterizing large amplitude nanosecond backbone fluctuations. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Membrane transporters rely on highly coordinated structural transitions between major conformational states for their function, to prevent simultaneous access of the substrate binding site to both sides of the membrane-amode of operation known as the alternating access model. Although this mechanismsuccessfully accounts for the efficient exchange of the primary substrate across the membrane, accruing evidence on significant water transport and even uncoupled ion transport mediated by transporters has challenged the concept of perfect mechanical coupling and coordination of the gatingmechanismin transporters,which might be expected fromthe alternating access model. Here, we present a large set of extended equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations performed on several classes of membrane transporters in different conformational states, to test the presence of the phenomenon in diverse transporter classes and to investigate the underlying molecularmechanism ofwater transport through membrane transporters. The simulations reveal spontaneous formation of transient water-conducting (channel-like) states allowing passive water diffusion through the lumen of the transporters. These channel-like states are permeable to water but occluded to substrate, thereby not hindering the uphill transport of the primary substrate, i.e., the alternating access model remains applicable to the substrate. The rise of such water-conducting states during the large-scale structural transitions of the transporter protein is indicative of imperfections in the coordinated closing and opening motions of the cytoplasmic and extracellular gates.We propose that the observed water-conducting states likely represent a universal phenomenon in membrane transporters, which is consistent with their reliance on large-scale motion for function.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) have a critical role in regulating neurotransmission and are targets for psychostimulants, anti-depressants and other drugs. Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance, in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter. In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent. The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions, and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters. However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1) renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Transport by aaLeuT is Cl- independent, whereas many neurotransmitter:sodium symporters from higher organisms depend on Cl- ions. However, the only Cl - ion identified in the aaLeuT structure interacts with nonconserved residues in extracellular loops, and thus the relevance of this binding site is unclear. Here, we use calculations of pKAs and homology modeling to predict the location of a functionally important Cl- binding site in serotonin transporter and other Cl--dependent transporters. We validate our model through the site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to coordinate the Cl- ion and through the observation of sequence conservation patterns in other Cl --dependent transporters. The proposed site is located midway across the membrane and is formed by residues from transmembrane helices 2, 6, and 7. It is close to the Na1 sodium binding site, thus providing an explanation for the coupling of Cl- and Na+ ions during transport. Other implications of the model are also discussed. {\textcopyright}2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Here we present an EPR-based protocol to help solving large RNA and protein-RNA complex structures in solution by providing long-range distance constraints between rigid fragments. Using enzymatic ligation of smaller RNA fragments, large doubly spin-labelled RNAs can be obtained permitting the acquisition of long distance distributions (>80{\AA}) within a large protein-RNA complex. Using a simple and fast calculation in torsion angle space of the spin-label distributions with the program CYANA, we can derive simple distance constraints between the spin labels and use them together with short-range distance restraints derived from NMR to determine the structure of a 70kDa protein-RNA complex composed of three subcomplexes. {\textcopyright}2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {LeuT, a prokaryotic member of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family, is an established structural model for mammalian NSS counterparts. We investigate the substrate translocation mechanism of LeuT by measuring the solution-phase structural dynamics of the transporter in distinct functional states by hydrogen/ deuteriumexchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Our HDX-MS data pinpoint LeuT segments involved in substrate transport and reveal for the first time a comprehensive and detailed view of the dynamics associated with transition of the transporter between outward- and inward-facing configurations in a Na+- and K+-dependent manner. The results suggest that partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1/5/6/7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state. These hitherto unknown, large-scale conformational changes in functionally important transmembrane segments, observed for LeuT in detergentsolubilized form and when embedded in a native-like phospholipid bilayer, could be of physiological relevance for the translocation process.},

ESCRT-I is a heterotetramer of Vps23, Vps28, Vps37, and Mvb12. The crystal structures of the core complex and the ubiquitin E2 variant and Vps28 C-terminal domains have been determined, but internal flexibility has prevented crystallization of intact ESCRT-I. Here we have characterized the structure of ESCRT-I in solution by simultaneous structural refinement against small-angle X-ray scattering and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy of spin-labeled complexes. An ensemble of at least six structures, comprising an equally populated mixture of closed and open conformations, was necessary to fit all of the data. This structural ensemble was cross-validated against single-molecule FRET spectroscopy, which suggested the presence of a continuum of open states. ESCRT-I in solution thus appears to consist of an approximately 50% population of one or a few related closed conformations, with the other 50% populating a continuum of open conformations. These conformations provide reference points for the structural pathway by which ESCRT-I induces membrane buds.},

abstract = {Interleaved dimers and higher order symmetric oligomers are ubiquitous in biology but present a challenge to de novo structure prediction methodology: The structure adopted by a monomer can be stabilized largely by interactions with other monomers and hence not the lowest energy state of a single chain. Building on the Rosetta framework, we present a general method to simultaneously model the folding and docking of multiple-chain interleaved homo-oligomers. For more than a third of the cases in a benchmark set of interleaved homo-oligomers, the method generates near-native models of large $\alpha$-helical bundles, interlocking $\beta$ sandwiches, and interleaved $\alpha$/$\beta$ motifs with an accuracy high enough for molecular replacement based phasing. With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 {\AA}rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta "fold-and-dock" protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with nearatomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.},

abstract = {Ligand binding can induce significant conformational changes in proteins. The mechanism of this process couples equilibria associated with the ligand binding event and the conformational change. Here we show that by combining the application of W-band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy with microfluidic rapid freeze quench ($\mu$RFQ) it is possible to resolve these processes and obtain both equilibrium constants and reaction rates. We studied the conformational transition of the nitroxide labeled, isolated carboxy-terminal cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) of the HCN2 ion channel upon binding of the ligand 3â²,5â²-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Using model-based global analysis, the time-resolved data of the $\mu$RFQ DEER experiments directly provide fractional populations of the open and closed conformations as a function of time. We modeled the ligand-induced conformational change in the protein using a four-state model: apo/open (AO), apo/closed (AC), bound/open (BO), bound/closed (BC). These species interconvert according to AC + L r AO + L r BO r BC. By analyzing the concentration dependence of the relative contributions of the closed and open conformations at equilibrium, we estimated the equilibrium constants for the two conformational equilibria and the open-state ligand dissociation constant. Analysis of the time-resolved $\mu$RFQ DEER data gave estimates for the intrinsic rates of ligand binding and unbinding as well as the rates of the conformational change. This demonstrates that DEER can quantitatively resolve both the thermodynamics and the kinetics of ligand binding and the associated conformational change.},

abstract = {Shallow electron spin echo envelope modulations due to dipole-dipole couplings between electron spins provide information on the radial distribution function of the spins in disordered systems while angular correlations between spin pairs are negligible. Under these conditions and in the absence of orientational selection, the dipolar time evolution data can be quantitatively simulated for arbitrary radial distribution functions by shell factorization, i.e., by performing the orientational average separately for thin spherical shells and multiplying the signals of all the shells. For distances below 5 nm, a linear superposition of the signals of the shells is sufficient. The dipolar time evolution data can be separated into this linear contribution and a nonlinear background. The linear contribution can then be converted directly to a radial distribution function. For a series of shape-persistent and flexible biradicals with end-to-end distances between 2 and 5 nm, shell factorization and direct conversion of the data are in good agreement with each other and with force-field computations of the end-to-end distances. The neglect of orientation selection does not cause significant distortions of the determined distance distributions. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

These channels gate by controlling the access of ions to a centrally located water-filled pore.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have uncovered significant conformational changes at the intracellular end of the second transmembrane helix (TM2) upon gating. We have used site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and EPR spectroscopy in an attempt to quantify the structural rearrangements of the KcsA TM2 bundle underlying the transition from the closed to the open state. Under conditions favoring the closed and open conformations, 10 intersubunit distances were obtained across TM2 segments from tandem dimer constructs. Analysis of these data points to a mechanism in which each TM2 helix tilts away from the permeation pathway, towards the membrane plane, and rotates about its helical axis, supporting a scissoring-type motion with a pivot point near residues 107-108. These movements are accompanied by a large increase in the diameter of the vestibule below the central water-filled cavity.},

This ellipsoidal protein has two globular domains and is approximately 52 {\AA}x 40 {\AA}x 35 {\AA}in size. The glutamine ligand is located in the cleft between the two domains and stablized by hydrogen bondings and ionic interactions with Asp10, Gly68, Thr70, Ala67, Asp157, Arg75, Lys115, Gly119 and His156. The aliphatic portion of the glutamine ligand is sandwiched in a hydrophobic pocket formed between Phe13 and Phe50 and has 21 van der Waals contacts with GlnBP. Lys115 and His156, that are unique to GlnBP among amino acid binding proteins, apparently contribute to the ligand binding specificity of GlnBP. Asp10 is within 3 {\AA}of Lys115. These two residues are over 10 {\AA}apart in the ligand-free form of the GlnBP. In addition, GlnBP-Gln exhibits a large-scale movement of the two hinges connecting the two globular domains upon ligand binding. The most significant changes are 41.1Â°in the $\phi$ angle of Gly89 and 34.3Â°in the $\phi$ angle of Glu181 from the first and the second hinge of the protein, respectively. Besides the original six hydrogen bonds, three extra hydrogen bonds can be observed between the two hinge strands upon ligand binding. A hydrogen bond network connects the large domain to the second hinge and a second hydrogen bond network coalesces the small domain to the same strand, both via interaction with the glutamine ligand. Although the two strands of the hinge connecting the domains do not directly participate in the ligand binding, Gln183 and Tyr185 from the second hinge may be involved in the cascade of the conformational change that is induced by ligand binding.},

Although the extent and the anisotropy of the Cu ESR spectrum provides challenges for PDS, Ku-band (17.3 GHz) double electron-electron resonance and double-quantum coherence variants of PDS coupled with distance reconstruction methods recover Cu-Cu distances in good agreement with crystal structures. Moreover, Cu-PDS measurements expose distinct differences between the conformational properties of wild-type SOD1 and a single-residue variant (I149T) that leads to the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The I149T protein displays a broader Cu-Cu distance distribution within the SOD1 dimer compared to wild-type. In a nitroxide (NO)-labeled sample, distance distributions obtained from Cu-Cu, Cu-NO, and NO-NO separations reveal increased structural heterogeneity within the protein and a tendency for mutant dimers to associate. In contrast, perturbations caused by the ALS mutation are completely masked in the crystal structure of I149T. Thus, PDS readily detects alterations in metalloenzyme solution properties not easily deciphered by other methods and in doing so supports the notion that increased range of motion and associations of SOD1 ALS variants contribute to disease progression.},

Candidate filtering relies on local conformation profile-profile comparison, together with physico-chemical scoring. Applied to three different template-based test sets, DaReUS-Loop shows significant increase in the number of high-accuracy loops, and significant enhancement for modeling long loops. A special advantage is that our method proposes a prediction confidence score that correlates well with the expected accuracy of the loops. Strikingly, over 50% of successful loop models are derived from unrelated proteins, indicating that fragments under similar constraints tend to adopt similar structure, beyond mere homology.},

abstract = {Integrative structure determination of macromolecular assemblies requires specifying the representation of the modeled structure, a scoring function for ranking alternative models based on diverse types of data, and a sampling method for generating these models. Structures are often represented at atomic resolution, although ad hoc simplified representations based on generic guidelines and/or trial and error are also used. In contrast, we introduce here the concept of optimizing representation. To illustrate this concept, the optimal representation is selected from a set of candidate representations based on an objective criterion that depends on varying amounts of information available for different parts of the structure. Specifically, an optimal representation is defined as the highest-resolution representation for which sampling is exhaustive at a precision commensurate with the precision of the representation. Thus, the method does not require an input structure and is applicable to any input information. We consider a space of representations in which a representation is a set of nonoverlapping, variable-length segments (i.e., coarse-grained beads) for each component protein sequence. We also implement a method for efficiently finding an optimal representation in our open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software (https://integrativemodeling.org/). The approach is illustrated by application to three complexes of two subunits and a large assembly of 10 subunits. The optimized representation facilitates exhaustive sampling and thus can produce a more accurate model and a more accurate estimate of its uncertainty for larger structures than were possible previously.},

Drugs that interfere with this reuptake mechanism, such as cocaine and antidepressants, profoundly influence behaviour and mood. To probe the nature of the conformational changes that are associated with substrate binding and transport, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay and combined it with functional and computational studies of the prokaryotic NSS homologue LeuT. Here we show molecular details of the modulation of intracellular gating of LeuT by substrates and inhibitors, as well as by mutations that alter binding, transport or both. Our direct observations of single-molecule transitions, reflecting structural dynamics of the intracellular region of the transporter that might be masked by ensemble averaging or suppressed under crystallographic conditions, are interpreted in the context of an allosteric mechanism that couples ion and substrate binding to transport. {\textcopyright}2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility of elucidating the bound ("closed") conformation of a periplasmic binding protein, the glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP), in solution, using paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from a single paramagnetic group. GlnBP consists of two globular domains connected by a hinge. Using the ligand-free ("open") conformation as a starting point, conjoined rigid-body/torsion-angle simulated annealing calculations were performed using backbone 1HN-PREs as a major source of distance information. Paramagnetic probe flexibility was accounted for via a multiple-conformer representation. A conventional approach where the entire PRE data set is enforced at once during simulated annealing yielded poor results due to inappropriate conformational sampling of the probe. On the other hand, significant improvements in coordinate accuracy were obtained by estimating the probe sampling space prior to structure calculation. Such sampling is achieved by refining the ensemble of probe conformers with intradomain PREs only, keeping the protein backbone fixed in the open form. Subsequently, while constraining the probe to the previously found conformations, the domains are allowed to move relative to each other under the influence of the non-intradomain PREs, giving the hinge region torsional degrees of freedom. Thus, by partitioning the protocol into "probe sampling" and "backbone sampling" stages, structures significantly closer to the X-ray structure of ligand-bound GlnBP were obtained. {\textcopyright}2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters use electrochemical gradient of ions to fuel the âuphillâ translocation of the substrate following the alternating-access model. The coupling of ions to conformational dynamics of the protein remains one of the least characterized aspects of the transporter function. We employ extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the Na+-binding effects on the structure and dynamics of a LeuT-fold, Na+-coupled secondary transporter (Mhp1) in its major conformational states, i.e., the outward-facing (OF) and inward-facing (IF) states, as well as on the OF â IF state transition. Microsecond-long, unbiased MD simulations illustrate that Na+ stabilizes an OF conformation favorable for substrate association, by binding to a highly conserved site at the interface between the two helical bundles and restraining their relative position and motion. Furthermore, a special-protocol biased simulation for state transition suggests that Na+ binding hinders the OF â IF transition. These synergistic Na+-binding effects allosterically couple the ion and substrate binding sites and modify the kinetics of state transition, collectively increasing the lifetime of an OF conformation with high substrate affinity, thereby facilitating substrate recruitment from a low-concentration environment. Based on the similarity between our findings for Mhp1 and experimental reports on LeuT, we propose that this model may represent a general Na+-coupling mechanism among LeuT-fold transporters.},

abstract = {When partitioning a set of objects into k clusters, the main objective is to find clusters the objects of which show a high degree of similarity. There are several possible criteria for quantifying this objective, the best known of which are based on sums of squares. An alternative approach, used in the k-medoid method, is of the L 1 type. It searches for k `representative' objects, called medoids, which minimize the average dissimilarity of all objects of the data set to the nearest medoid. A cluster is then defined as the set of objects which have been assigned to the same medoid. An algorithm for this method has been implemented in the PAM program which is described in the paper. The k-medoid method offers the advantage of not requiring the actual measurement data, as it can also be applied to a collection of dissimilarities. Such dissimilarities are for example subjective assessments of relationships between objects, in which case no measurements exist. An example of the latter type is analyzed. Furthermore, the k-medoid method is less susceptible to outlying values},

The final model has bond lengths and bond angles that differ from "ideal" values by 0.019 {\AA}and 2.7 Â°, respectively. The crystals are grown from electron-dense phosphate solutions and the use of an appropriate solvent continuum substantially improved the agreement between the observed and calculated structure factors at low resolution. Apart from changes in the conformations of some side-chains, the refinement confirms the structure of the molecule as initially derived from a 2.4 {\AA}resolution electron density map. There are 118 well-ordered solvent molecules that are associated with the T4 lysozyme molecule in the crystal. Four of these are more-or-less buried. There is a clustering of water molecules within the active site cleft but, other than this, the solvent molecules are dispersed around the surface of the molecule and do not aggregate into ice-like structures or pentagonal or hexagonal clusters. The apparent motion of T4 lysozyme in the crystal can be interpreted in terms of significant interdomain motion corresponding to an opening and closing of the active site cleft. For the amino-terminal domain the motion can be described equally well (correlation coefficients approx. 0.87) as quasi-rigid-body motion either about a point or about an axis of rotation. The motion in the crystals of the carboxy-terminal domain is best described as rotation about an axis (correlation coefficient 0.80) although in this case the apparent motion seems to be influenced in part by crystal contacts and may be of questionable relevance to dynamics in solution. {\textcopyright}1987.},

While the detailed mechanism of this energy transfer has not been fully elucidated, the ATP apparently forms an amino acid anhydride. The fact that an anhydride of rela- tively high-energy content is the method of driving the reaction thermodynamically fits in with organic practice in which acyl anhydrides are the usual reagents for acylations. In addition to thermodynamic activation, there is a needed "kinetic activation." For example, the acyl phosphates and acyl adenylates acylate amines non-enzymatically at appreciable rates in aqueous solution, but this reaction is certainly not rapid enough or selective enough to account for protein synthesis. The reaction of these acyl anhydrides to form peptides must be catalyzed, and it is this catalysis which is the subject of this paper.},

abstract = {We have constructed stable cell lines expressing transporters for dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) by transfection with cloned cDNAs. The parental LLC-PK1 cell does not express any of these neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, monoamine transport activities in each of these cell lines are due to the transfected DNA only, allowing comparison in the same background. Drug inhibition profiles for each cell line are distinct and as expected for each transporter. LLC-NET and LLC-DAT cells transported both NE and DA and both cell types exhibited a lower K(M) for DA transport than for NE transport. Analysis of V(max) data for LLC-NET cells suggests that substrate is bound to the NE transporter during the rate- limiting step(s) in transport. The cocaine analog 2-$\beta$-carbomethoxy-3$\beta$-(4- [125I]iodophenyl)tropane binds to each cell type, and is displaced by transport substrate in each case. Binding and transport measurements on parallel cell cultures allowed estimation of turnover numbers for norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin transporters. All three transporters require external Na+ and Cl-. The Na+ concentration dependence suggests that a single Na+ ion is involved in transport catalyzed by norepinephrine and serotonin transporters while more than one Na+ ion participate in transport mediated by the dopamine transporter.},

We investigated whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occuring proteins used in training the models. We generated random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting distance maps, which as expected are quite featureless. We then carried out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (KL-divergence) between the distance distributions predicted by the network and the background distribution. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in a wide range of proteins with diverse sequences and all alpha, all beta sheet, and mixed alpha-beta structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of these network hallucinated sequences, expressed and purified the proteins in E coli, and found that 27 folded to monomeric stable structures with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. Thus deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute, alongside traditional physically based models, to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.},

This requires a technique for obtaining normalized B-factors. Since then the exploitation of B-factors has been extensively elaborated and applied in a variety of studies with quite different goals, all having in common the identification and interpretation of rigidity, flexibility, and/or internal motion which are crucial in enzymes and in proteins in general. Importantly, this review includes a discussion of limitations and possible pitfalls when using B-factors. A second research area, which likewise exploits B-factors, is also reviewed, namely, the development of the so-called B-FIT-directed evolution method for increasing the thermostability of enzymes as catalysts in organic chemistry and biotechnology.

abstract = {Sodium-coupled transporters are ubiquitous pumps that harness pre-existing sodium gradients to catalyse the thermodynamically unfavourable uptake of essential nutrients, neurotransmitters and inorganic ions across the lipid bilayer. Dysfunction of these integral membrane proteins has been implicated in glucose/galactose malabsorption, congenital hypothyroidism, Bartter's syndrome, epilepsy, depression, autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sodium-coupled transporters are blocked by a number of therapeutically important compounds, including diuretics, anticonvulsants and antidepressants, many of which have also become indispensable tools in biochemical experiments designed to probe antagonist binding sites and to elucidate transport mechanisms. Steady-state kinetic data have revealed that both competitive and noncompetitive modes of inhibition exist. Antagonist dissociation experiments on the serotonin transporter (SERT) have also unveiled the existence of a low-affinity allosteric site that slows the dissociation of inhibitors from a separate high-affinity site. Despite these strides, atomic-level insights into inhibitor action have remained elusive. Here we screen a panel of molecules for their ability to inhibit LeuT, a prokaryotic homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter sodium symporters, and show that the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine noncompetitively inhibits substrate uptake. Cocrystal structures show that clomipramine, along with two other TCAs, binds in an extracellular-facing vestibule about 11 {\AA}above the substrate and two sodium ions, apparently stabilizing the extracellular gate in a closed conformation. Off-rate assays establish that clomipramine reduces the rate at which leucine dissociates from LeuT and reinforce our contention that this TCA inhibits LeuT by slowing substrate release. Our results represent a molecular view into noncompetitive inhibition of a sodium-coupled transporter and define principles for the rational design of new inhibitors. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

LAT1 is overexpressed in many types of tumors and mediates the transfer of drugs and hormones across the blood-brain barrier. Thus, LAT1 is considered as a drug target for cancer treatment and may be exploited for drug delivery into the brain. Here, we synthesized three potent inhibitors of human LAT1, which inhibit transport of leucine with IC50 values between 100 and 250 nM, and solved the cryo-EM structures of the corresponding LAT1-4F2hc complexes with these inhibitors bound at resolution of up to 2.7 or 2.8 {\AA}. The protein assumes an outward-facing occluded conformation, with the inhibitors bound in the classical substrate binding pocket, but with their tails wedged between the substrate binding site and TM10 of LAT1. We also solved the complex structure of LAT1-4F2hc with 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine (Diiodo-Tyr) at 3.4 {\AA}overall resolution, which revealed a different inhibition mechanism and might represent an intermediate conformation between the outward-facing occluded state mentioned above and the outward-open state. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the outward-facing conformation is revealed for the HAT family. Our results unveil more important insights into the working mechanisms of HATs and provide a structural basis for future drug design.},

abstract = {Site specific incorporation of molecular probes such as fluorescent- and nitroxide spin-labels into biomolecules, and subsequent analysis by F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) can elucidate the distance and distance-changes between the probes. However, the probes have an intrinsic conformational flexibility due to the linker by which they are conjugated to the biomolecule. This property minimizes the influence of the label side chain on the structure of the target molecule, but complicates the direct correlation of the experimental inter-label distances with the macromolecular structure or changes thereof. Simulation methods that account for the conformational flexibility and orientation of the probe(s) can be helpful in overcoming this problem. We performed distance measurements using FRET and DEER and explored different simulation techniques to predict inter-label distances using the Rpo4/7 stalk module of the M. jannaschii RNA polymerase. This is a suitable model system because it is rigid and a high-resolution X-ray structure is available. The conformations of the fluorescent labels and nitroxide spin labels on Rpo4/7 were modeled using in vacuo molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and a stochastic Monte Carlo sampling approach. For the nitroxide probes we also performed MD simulations with explicit water and carried out a rotamer library analysis. Our results show that the Monte Carlo simulations are in better agreement with experiments than the MD simulations and the rotamer library approach results in plausible distance predictions. Because the latter is the least computationally demanding of the methods we have explored, and is readily available to many researchers, it prevails as the method of choice for the interpretation of DEER distance distributions. {\textcopyright}2012 Klose et al.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated ion channels respond to transmembrane electric fields through reorientations of the positively charged S4 helix within the voltage-sensing domain (VSD). Despite a wealth of structural and functional data, the details of this conformational change remain controversial. Recent electrophysiological evidence showed that equilibrium between the resting ('down') and activated ('up') conformations of the KvAP VSD from Aeropyrum pernix can be biased through reconstitution in lipids with or without phosphate groups. We investigated the structural transition between these functional states, using site-directed spin-labeling and EPR spectroscopic methods. Solvent accessibility and interhelical distance determinations suggest that KvAP gates through S4 movements involving an â¼3-{\AA}upward tilt and simultaneous â¼2-{\AA}axial shift. This motion leads to large accessibly changes in the intracellular water-filled crevice and supports a new model of gating that combines structural rearrangements and electric-field remodeling. {\textcopyright}2014 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {LeuT is a bacterial homologue of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family and, being the only NSS member to have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography, is a model protein for studying transporter structure and mechanism. Transport activity in LeuT was hypothesized to require structural transitions between open-to-out and occluded conformations dependent upon protein:ligand binding complementarity. Here, using crystallographic and functional analysis, we show that binding site modification produces changes in both structure and activity that are consistent with complementarity-dependent structural transitions to the occluded state. The mutation I359Q converts the activity of tryptophan from inhibitor to transportable substrate. This mutation changes the local environment of the binding site, inducing the bound tryptophan to adopt a different conformer than in the wild-type complex. Instead of trapping the transporter open, tryptophan binding now allows the formation of an occluded state. Thus, transport activity is correlated to the ability of the ligand to promote the structural transition to the occluded state, a step in the transport cycle that is dependent on protein:ligand complementarity in the central binding site. {\textcopyright}2012 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {GadC, a central component of the Escherichia coli acid resistance system, is a Glu/GABA antiporter. A previous structural study and biochemical characterization showed that GadC exhibits a stringent pH dependence for substrate transport, with no detectable activity at pH values above 6.5. However, the substrate selectivity and the mechanism of pH-dependent transport activity of GadC remain enigmatic. In this study, we demonstrate that GadC selectively transports Glu with no net charge and GABA with a positive charge. AC-plug-truncated variant of GadC (residues 1-470) transported Gln (a mimic of Glu with no net charge), but not Glu, even at pH 8.0. The pH-dependent transport of Gln by this GadC variant was shifted â¼1 unit toward a higher pH compared with Glu transport. Taken together, the results identify the substrate selectivity for GadC and show that the protonation states of substrates are crucial for transport. {\textcopyright}2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a widely applied biophysical technique that probes the structure and dynamics of biomolecules without the need for site-directed modifications or bio-orthogonal labels. The mechanistic interpretation of HDX data, however, is often qualitative and subjective, owing to a lack of quantitative methods to rigorously translate observed deuteration levels into atomistic structural information. To help address this problem, we have developed a methodology to generate structural ensembles that faithfully reproduce HDX-MS measurements. In this approach, an ensemble of protein conformations is first generated, typically using molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-entropy bias is then applied post hoc to the resulting ensemble such that averaged peptide-deuteration levels, as predicted by an empirical model, agree with target values within a given level of uncertainty. We evaluate this approach, referred to as HDX ensemble reweighting (HDXer), for artificial target data reflecting the two major conformational states of a binding protein. We demonstrate that the information provided by HDX-MS experiments and by the model of exchange are sufficient to recover correctly weighted structural ensembles from simulations, even when the relevant conformations are rarely observed. Degrading the information content of the target dataâe.g., by reducing sequence coverage, by averaging exchange levels over longer peptide segments, or by incorporating different sources of uncertaintyâreduces the structural accuracy of the reweighted ensemble but still allows for useful insights into the distinctive structural features reflected by the target data. Finally, we describe a quantitative metric to rank candidate structural ensembles according to their correspondence with target data and illustrate the use of HDXer to describe changes in the conformational ensemble of the membrane protein LeuT. In summary, HDXer is designed to facilitate objective structural interpretations of HDX-MS data and to inform experimental approaches and further developments of theoretical exchange models.},

Systematic application of spin labeling and EPR identifies sequence-specific secondary structures, defines their topology and their packing in the tertiary fold. Long range distance measurements (60 -80 ) between pairs of spin labels enable quantitative analysis of equilibrium dynamics and triggered conformational changes.

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size e and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter e on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Matthew D.

abstract = {Computational protein design of an ensemble of conformations for one proteinâi.e., multi-state designâdetermines the side chain identity by optimizing the energetic contributions of that side chain in each of the backbone conformations. Sampling the resulting large sequence-structure search space limits the number of conformations and the size of proteins in multi-state design algorithms. Here, we demonstrated that the REstrained CONvergence (RECON) algorithm can simultaneously evaluate the sequence of large proteins that undergo substantial conformational changes. Simultaneous optimization of side chain conformations across all conformations increased sequence conservation when compared to single-state designs in all cases. More importantly, the sequence space sampled by RECON MSD resembled the evolutionary sequence space of flexible proteins, particularly when confined to predicting the mutational preferences of limited common ancestral descent, such as in the case of influenza type A hemagglutinin. Additionally, we found that sequence positions which require substantial changes in their local environment across an ensemble of conformations are more likely to be conserved. These increased conservation rates are better captured by RECON MSD over multiple conformations and thus multiple local residue environments during design. To quantify this rewiring of contacts at a certain position in sequence and structure, we introduced a new metric designated âcontact proximity deviation' that enumerates contact map changes. This measure allows mapping of global conformational changes into local side chain proximity adjustments, a property not captured by traditional global similarity metrics such as RMSD or local similarity metrics such as changes in $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles.},

We investigated whether the information captured by such networks is sufficiently rich to generate new folded proteins with sequences unrelated to those of the naturally occuring proteins used in training the models. We generated random amino acid sequences, and input them into the trRosetta structure prediction network to predict starting distance maps, which as expected are quite featureless. We then carried out Monte Carlo sampling in amino acid sequence space, optimizing the contrast (KL-divergence) between the distance distributions predicted by the network and the background distribution. Optimization from different random starting points resulted in a wide range of proteins with diverse sequences and all alpha, all beta sheet, and mixed alpha-beta structures. We obtained synthetic genes encoding 129 of these network hallucinated sequences, expressed and purified the proteins in E coli, and found that 27 folded to monomeric stable structures with circular dichroism spectra consistent with the hallucinated structures. Thus deep networks trained to predict native protein structures from their sequences can be inverted to design new proteins, and such networks and methods should contribute, alongside traditional physically based models, to the de novo design of proteins with new functions.},

For this purpose, crystal structures have been determined for T4 lysozyme bearing a nitroxide side chain (R1) at the solvent-exposed helical sites 41 and 44 in the B helix. These sites are of particular interest in that the corresponding EPR spectra reveal two dynamic states of R1, one of which is relatively immobilized suggesting interactions of the nitroxide with the environment. The crystal structures together with the effect of mutagenesis of nearest neighbors on the motion of R1 suggest intrahelical interactions of 41R1 with the i + 4 residue and of 44R1 with the i + 1 residue. Such interactions appear to be specific to particular rotamers of the R1 side chain.},

abstract = {X-ray crystallography has been a useful tool in the development of site-directed spin labeling by resolving rotamers of the nitroxide spin-label side chain in a variety of $\alpha$-helical environments. In this work, the crystal structure of a doubly spin-labeled N8C/K28C mutant of the B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G (GB1) was solved. The double mutant formed a domain-swapped dimer under crystallization conditions. Two rotameric states of the spin-label were resolved at the solvent-exposed $\alpha$-helical site, at residue 28; these are in good agreement with rotamers previously reported for helical structures. The second site, at residue 8 on an interior $\beta$-strand, shows the presence of three distinct solvent-exposed side-chain rotamers. One of these rotamers is rarely observed within crystal structures of R1 sites and suggests that the H $\alpha$ and S $\delta$ hydrogen bond that is common to $\alpha$-helical sites is absent at this interior $\beta$-strand residue. Variable temperature continuous wave (CW) experiments of the $\beta$-strand site showed two distinct components that were correlated to the rotameric states observed in crystallography. Interestingly, the CW data at room temperature could be fit without the use of an order parameter, which is consistent with the lack of the H $\alpha$ and S $\delta$ interaction. Additionally, double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy was performed on the GB1 double mutant in its monomeric form and yielded a most probable interspin distance of 25 Â± 1 {\AA}. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the measured DEER distance, the rotamers observed in the crystal structure of the domain-swapped GB1 dimer were modeled into a high-resolution structure of the wild type monomeric GB1. The distances generated in the resulting GB1 structural models match the most probable DEER distance within â¼2 {\AA}. The results are interesting as they indicate by direct experimental measurement that the rotameric states of R1 found in this crystal provide a very close match to the most probable distance measured by DEER. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {De novo membrane protein structure prediction is limited to small proteins due to the conformational search space quickly expanding with length. Long-range contacts (24+ amino acid separation)-residue positions distant in sequence, but in close proximity in the structure, are arguably the most effective way to restrict this conformational space. Inverse methods for co-evolutionary analysis predict a global set of position-pair couplings that best explain the observed amino acid co-occurrences, thus distinguishing between evolutionarily explained co-variances and these arising from spurious transitive effects. Here, we show that applying machine learning approaches and custom descriptors improves evolutionary contact prediction accuracy, resulting in improvement of average precision by 6 percentage points for the top 1L non-local contacts. Further, we demonstrate that predicted contacts improve protein folding with BCL:Fold. The mean RMSD100 metric for the top 10 models folded was reduced by an average of 2 {\AA} for a benchmark of 25 membrane proteins.},

A variety of search models derived from the diferric lactoferrin structure (Fe2Lf) were used to obtain a consistent solution to the rotation function. An R-factor search gave the correct translational solution and the model was refined by rigid-body least-squares refinement (program CORELS). Only three of the four domains were located correctly by this procedure, however; the fourth was finally placed correctly by rotating it manually onto three strands of electron density which were recognized as part of its central/3-sheet. The final model, refined by restrained least-squares methods to an R factor of 0.214 for data in the resolution range 10.0 to 2.8 A$\sim$, shows a large domain movement in the N-terminal half of the molecule (a 54 rotation of domain N2) and smaller domain movements elsewhere, when compared with Fe=Lf. A feature of the crystal structure is that although the ApoLf and Fe2Lf unit cells appear very similar, their crystal packing and molecular structures are quite different.},

The secondary, super-secondary and domain structures of the pyridoxal-phosphate holoenzyme at pH 7.5 are described in detail. The surface area of the interface between the monomer subunits of this dimeric $\alpha$2 protein is unusually large, indicating a very stable dimer. This is consistent with biochemical data. Both subunit and domain interfaces are relatively smooth compared with other proteins. The interactions of the protein with its co-factor are described and compared among the three structures. Observed changes in co-factor conformation may be related to spectral changes and the energetics of the catalytic reaction. Small but significant adjustments of the protein to changes in co-factor conformation are seen. These adjustments may be accommodated by small rigid-body shifts of secondary structural elements, and by packing defects in the protein core. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The subunits of the dimeric enzyme aspartate aminotransferase have two domains: one large and one small. The active site lies in a cavity that is close to both the subunit interface and the interface between the two domains. On binding the substrate the domains close together. This closure completely buries the substrate in the active site and moves two arginine side-chains so they form salt bridges with carboxylate groups of the substrate. The salt bridges hold the substrate close to the pyridoxal 5â²-phosphate cofactor and in the right position and orientation for the catalysis of the transamination reaction. We describe here the structural changes that produce the domain movements and the closure of the active site. Structural changes occur at the interface between the domains and within the small domain itself. On closure, the core of the small domain rotates by 13 Â° relative to the large domain. Two other regions of the small domain, which form part of the active site, move somewhat differently. A loop, residues 39 to 49, above the active site moves about 1 {\AA} less than the core of the small domain. A helix within the small domain forms the "door" of the active site. It moves with the core of the small domain and, in addition, shifts by 1{\textperiodcentered}2 {\AA}, rotates by 10 Â°, and switches its first turn from the $\alpha$ to the 310 conformation. This results in the helix closing the active site. The domain movements are produced by a co-ordinated series of small changes. Within one subunit the polypeptide chain passes twice between the large and small domains. One link involves a peptide in an extended conformation. The second link is in the middle of a long helix that spans both domains. At the interface this helix is kinked and, on closure, the angle of the kink changes to accommodate the movement of the small domain. The interface between the domains is formed by 15 residues in the large domain packing against 12 residues in the small domain and the manner in which these residues pack is essentially the same in the open and closed structures. Domain movements involve changes in the main-chain and side-chain torsion angles in the residues on both sides of the interface. Most of these changes are small; only a few side-chains switch to new conformations. The result of these changes in conformation is to move interface residues in the small domain by between 0{\textperiodcentered}2 and 3{\textperiodcentered}3 {\AA} relative to the large domain and so produce the relative rotation of the two domains. In both the open and closed forms the interface residues are close packed and almost all have normally allowed conformations. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by pseudo 4-fold screw symmetry. The refined model consists of 3587 non-hydrogen atoms from 440 residues (two monomers), and 159 water molecules. The structure has root-mean-square deviations of 0.013 {\AA} from 'ideal' bond lengths and 1.5Â° from 'ideal' bond angles. The GlnBP molecule has overall dimensions of approximately 60 {\AA} x 40 {\AA} x 35 {\AA} and is made up of two domains (termed large and small), which exhibit a similar supersecondary structure, linked by two antiparallel $\beta$-strands. The small domain contains three $\alpha$-helices and four parallel and one antiparallel $\beta$-strands. The large domain is similar to the small domain but contains two additional $\alpha$-helices and three more short antiparallel $\beta$-strands. A comparison of the secondary structural motifs of GlnBP with those of other periplasmic binding proteins is discussed. A model of the 'closed form' GlnBP-Gln complex has been proposed based on the crystal structures of the histidine-binding protein-His complex and 'open form' GlnBP. This model has been successfully used as a search model in the crystal structure determination of the 'closed form' GlnBP-Gln complex by molecular replacement methods. The model agrees remarkably well with the crystal structure of the Gln-GlnBP complex with root-mean-square deviation of 1.29 {\AA}. Our study shows that, at least in our case, it is possible to predict one conformational state of a periplasmic binding protein from another conformational state of the protein. The glutamine-binding pockets of the model and the crystal structure are compared and the modeling technique is described.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP) complexed with its ligand (Gln) was determined and refined to 1.94 {\AA} resolution. This ellipsoidal protein has two globular domains and is approximately 52 {\AA} x 40 {\AA} x 35 {\AA} in size. The glutamine ligand is located in the cleft between the two domains and stablized by hydrogen bondings and ionic interactions with Asp10, Gly68, Thr70, Ala67, Asp157, Arg75, Lys115, Gly119 and His156. The aliphatic portion of the glutamine ligand is sandwiched in a hydrophobic pocket formed between Phe13 and Phe50 and has 21 van der Waals contacts with GlnBP. Lys115 and His156, that are unique to GlnBP among amino acid binding proteins, apparently contribute to the ligand binding specificity of GlnBP. Asp10 is within 3 {\AA} of Lys115. These two residues are over 10 {\AA} apart in the ligand-free form of the GlnBP. In addition, GlnBP-Gln exhibits a large-scale movement of the two hinges connecting the two globular domains upon ligand binding. The most significant changes are 41.1Â°in the $\phi$ angle of Gly89 and 34.3Â°in the $\phi$ angle of Glu181 from the first and the second hinge of the protein, respectively. Besides the original six hydrogen bonds, three extra hydrogen bonds can be observed between the two hinge strands upon ligand binding. A hydrogen bond network connects the large domain to the second hinge and a second hydrogen bond network coalesces the small domain to the same strand, both via interaction with the glutamine ligand. Although the two strands of the hinge connecting the domains do not directly participate in the ligand binding, Gln183 and Tyr185 from the second hinge may be involved in the cascade of the conformational change that is induced by ligand binding.},

abstract = {The X-ray crystal structure of adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyltransferase (CobU) from Salmonella typhimurium bound to GMP has been determined by molecular replacement to 2.2 {\AA} resolution. CobU is a bifunctional enzyme, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 1-amino-O-2-propanol side chain of the adenosylcobinamide ring and subsequently functions as a guanylyltransferase to form adenosylcobinamide. GDP. The transferase activity involves a covalent enzyme-guanylyl intermediate that is most likely a phosphoramidate linkage to His46. Previous studies have shown that the enzyme is a homotrimer and adopts a pinwheel shape. Each subunit consists of a single domain of six parallel $\beta$-strands and one antiparallel strand flanked on either side by a total of five $\alpha$-helices and one helical turn. Interestingly, His46 in the apoenzyme is located a considerable distance from the kinase active site or P-loop motif and is solvent-exposed [Thompson, T. B., et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 7686-7695]. To examine the structural relationship of the two active sites, CobU was cocrystallized with GTP and pyrophosphate. Crystals belong to space group P212121 with the following unit cell dimensions: a = 58.4 {\AA}, b = 87.8 {\AA}, and c = 101.6 {\AA}. The structure shows electron density for the hydrolysis product GMP rather than the expected covalent guanylyl intermediate which appears to have been hydrolyzed in the crystal lattice. Even so, CobU exhibits a substantial conformational rearrangement. The helix axis containing His46, the site of guanylylation, rotates 30Â°and translates 11 relative to the apo structure and is accompanied by compensatory unwinding and rewinding at the helix ends to allow the induction of a guanosine binding pocket between $\beta$-strand 2 and $\alpha$- helix 2. This conformational change brings the C($\alpha$) of His46 approximately 10 {\AA} closer to the P-loop motif such that a phosphate ion located in the P- loop is only 6 {\AA} from the $\alpha$-phosphate of GMP. This suggests that the P-loop motif may be used to coordinate the terminal phosphates in both the transferase and kinase reactions and implies that the active sites for both reactions overlap.},

abstract = {The X-ray structure of adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide phosphate guanylyl-transferase (CobU) from Salmonella typhimurium has been determined to 2.3 {\AA} resolution. This enzyme of subunit molecular weight 19 770 plays a central role in the assembly of the nucleotide loop for adenosylcobalamin where it catalyzes both the phosphorylation of the 1- amino-2-propanol side chain of the corrin ring and the subsequent attachment of GMP to form the product adenosylcobinamide-GDP. The kinase activity is believed to be associated with a P-loop motif, whereas the transferase activity proceeds at a different site on the enzyme via a guanylyl intermediate. The enzyme was crystallized in the space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 96.4 {\AA}, b = 114.4 {\AA}, and c = 106.7 {\AA}, with three subunits per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the enzyme is a molecular trimer and appears somewhat like a propeller with overall molecular dimensions of approximately 64 {\AA} x 77 {\AA}, x 131 {\AA}. Each subunit consists of a single domain that is dominated by a seven-stranded mixed $\beta$-sheet flanked on either side by a total of five $\alpha$-helices and one helical turn. Six of the seven $\beta$-strands run parallel. The C-terminal strand lies at the edge of the sheet and runs antiparallel to the others. Interestingly, CobU displays a remarkable structural and topological similarity to the central domain of the RecA protein, although the reason for this observation is unclear. The structure contains a P-loop motif located at the base of a prominent cleft formed by the association of two subunits and is most likely the kinase active site. Each subunit of CobU contains a cis peptide bond between Glu80 and Cys80 where Glu80 faces the P-loop and might serve to coordinate the magnesium ion of the triphosphate substrate. Interestingly, His46, which is the putative site for guanylylation, lies $\sim$21 {\AA} from the P-loop and is solvent-exposed. This suggests that the enzyme undergoes a conformational change when the substrates bind to bring these two active sites into closer proximity.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of a protein sequence is one of the most frequent problems in biology. This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

abstract = {Integrative modeling is an increasingly important tool in structural biology, providing structures by combining data from varied experimental methods and prior information. As a result, molecular architectures of large, heterogeneous, and dynamic systems, such as the â¼52-MDa Nuclear Pore Complex, can be mapped with useful accuracy, precision, and completeness. Key challenges in improving integrative modeling include expanding model representations, increasing the variety of input data and prior information, quantifying a match between input information and a model in a Bayesian fashion, inventing more efficient structural sampling, as well as developing better model validation, analysis, and visualization. In addition, two community-level challenges in integrative modeling are being addressed under the auspices of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB). First, the impact of integrative structures is maximized by PDB-Development, a prototype wwPDB repository for archiving, validating, visualizing, and disseminating integrative structures. Second, the scope of structural biology is expanded by linking the wwPDB resource for integrative structures with archives of data that have not been generally used for structure determination but are increasingly important for computing integrative structures, such as data from various types of mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, optical microscopy, proteomics, and genetics. To address the largest of modeling problems, a type of integrative modeling called metamodeling is being developed; metamodeling combines different types of input models as opposed to different types of data to compute an output model. Collectively, these developments will facilitate the structural biology mindset in cell biology and underpin spatiotemporal mapping of the entire cell.},

abstract = {Bacterial pathogens are a major cause of foodborne diseases and food poisoning. To cope with the acid conditions encountered in different environments such as in fermented food or in the gastric compartment, neutralophilic bacteria have developed several adaptive mechanisms. One of those mechanisms, the amino acid dependent system, consumes intracellular protons in biochemical reactions. It involves an antiporter that facilitates the exchange of external substrate amino acid for internal product and a cytoplasmic decarboxylase that catalyzes a proton-consuming decarboxylation of the substrate. So far, four acid resistance antiporters have been discovered, namely the glutamate-$\gamma$-aminobutyric acid antiporter GadC, the arginine-agmatine antiporter AdiC, the lysine-cadaverine antiporter CadB, and the ornithine-putrescine antiporter PotE. The 3D structures of AdiC and GadC, reveal an inverted-repeat fold of two times 5 transmembrane helices, typical of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily of transporters. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the transport mechanism, the pH regulation and the selectivity of these four acid resistance antiporters. It also highlights that AdiC is a paradigm for eukaryotic amino acid transporters of the APC superfamily as structural models of several of these transporters built using AdiC structures were exploited to unveil their mechanisms of amino acid recognition and translocation.},

abstract = {We describe an approach for integrating distance restraints from Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy into Rosetta with the purpose of modeling alternative protein conformations from an initial experimental structure. Fundamental to this approach is a multilateration algorithm that harnesses sets of interconnected spin label pairs to identify optimal rotamer ensembles at each residue that fit the DEER decay in the time domain. Benchmarked relative to data analysis packages, the algorithm yields comparable distance distributions with the advantage that fitting the DEER decay and rotamer ensemble optimization are coupled. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the protonation-dependent transition of the multidrug transporter PfMATE to an inward facing conformation with a deviation to the experimental structure of less than 2{\AA} C$\alpha$ RMSD. By decreasing spin label rotamer entropy, this approach engenders more accurate Rosetta models that are also more closely clustered, thus setting the stage for more robust modeling of protein conformational changes.},

abstract = {De novo construction of loop regions is an important problem in computational structural biology. Compared to regions with well-defined secondary structure, loops tend to exhibit significant conformational heterogeneity. As a result, their structures are often ambiguous when determined using experimental data obtained by crystallography, cryo-EM, or NMR. Although structurally diverse models could provide a more relevant representation of proteins in their native states, obtaining large numbers of biophysically realistic and physiologically relevant loop conformations is a resource-consuming task. To address this need, we developed a novel loop construction algorithm, Hash/RCD, that combines knowledge-based conformational hashing with random coordinate descent (RCD). This hybrid approach achieved a closure rate of 100% on a benchmark set of 195 loops in 29 proteins that range from 3 to 31 residues. More importantly, the use of templates allows Hash/RCD to maintain the accuracy of state-of-the-art coordinate descent methods while reducing sampling time from over 400 to 141 ms. These results highlight how the integration of coordinate descent with knowledge-based sampling overcomes barriers inherent to either approach in isolation. This method may facilitate the identification of native-like loop conformations using experimental data or full-atom scoring functions by allowing rapid sampling of large numbers of loops. In this manuscript, we investigate and discuss the advantages, bottlenecks, and limitations of combining conformational hashing with RCD. By providing a detailed technical description of the Hash/RCD algorithm, we hope to facilitate its implementation by other researchers.},

@article{Karatzas2010a,
abstract = {It is well established that the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system is central to the survival of Listeria monocytogenes at low pH, both in acidic foods and within the mammalian stomach. The accepted model proposes that under acidic conditions extracellular glutamate is transported into the cell in exchange for an intracellular $\gamma$-aminobutyrate (GABA1). The glutamate is then decarboxylated to GABA1, a reaction that consumes a proton, thereby helping to prevent acidification of the cytoplasm. In this study, we show that glutamate supplementation had no influence on either growth rate at pH 5.0 or survival at pH 2.5 when L. monocytogenes 10403S was grown in a chemically defined medium (DM), In response to acidification, cells grown in DM failed to efflux GABA, even when glutamate was added to the medium. In contrast, in brain heart infusion (BHI), the same strain produced significant extracellular GABA (GABAe) in response to acidification. In addition, high levels Of GABAi (>80 mM) were found in the cytoplasm in response to low pH in both growth media. Medium-swap and medium-mixing experiments revealed that the GABA efflux apparatus was nonfunctional in DM, even when glutamate was present. It was also found that the GadT2D2 antiporter/decarboxylase system was transcribed poorly in DM-grown cultures while overexpression of gadDlTl and gadD3 occurred in response to pH 3.5. Interestingly, BHI-grown cells did not respond with upregulation of any of the GAD system genes when challenged at pH 3.5. The accumulation of GABAi in cells grown in DM in the absence of extracellular glutamate indicates that intracellular glutamate is the source of the GABA1. These results demonstrate that GABA production can be uncoupled from GABA efflux, a finding that alters the way we should view the operation of bacterial GAD systems.

To dissect the activation mechanism, structural homology was used to identify an unstructured loop of approximately 20 residues in the ExoU amino acid sequence. Mutational analyses indicate the importance of specific loop amino acid residues in mediating catalytic activity. Engineered disulfide cross-links show that loop movement is required for activation. Site directed spin labeling EPR and DEER (double electronâelectron resonance) studies of apo and holo states demonstrate local conformational changes at specific sites within the loop and a conformational shift of the loop during activation. These data are consistent with the formation of a substrate-binding pocket providing access to the catalytic site. DEER distance distributions were used as constraints in RosettaDEER to construct ensemble models of the loop in both apo and holo states, significantly extending the range for modeling a conformationally dynamic loop.},

TM-align is applied to an all-against-all structure comparison of 10515 representative protein chains from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a sequence identity cutoff <95%: 1996 distinct folds are found when a TM-score threshold of 0.5 is used.

For both folded and misfolded models, TM-align can almost always find close structural analogs, with an average root mean square deviation, RMSD, of 3 {\AA} and 87% alignment coverage. Nevertheless, there exists a significant correlation between the correctness of the predicted structure and the structural similarity of the model to the other proteins in the PDB.

abstract = {EmrE, a member of the small multidrug transporters superfamily, extrudes positively charged hydrophobic compounds out of Escherichia coli cytoplasm in exchange for inward movement of protons down their electrochemical gradient. Although its transport mechanism has been thoroughly characterized, the structural basis of energy coupling and the conformational cycle mediating transport have yet to be elucidated. In this study, EmrE structure in liposomes and the substrate-induced conformational changes were investigated by systematic spin labeling and EPR analysis. Spin label mobilities and accessibilities describe a highly dynamic ligand-free (apo) conformation. Dipolar coupling between spin labels across the dimer reveals at least two spin label populations arising from different packing interfaces of the EmrE dimer. One population is consistent with antiparallel arrangement of the monomers, although the EPR parameters suggest deviations from the crystal structure of substrate-bound EmrE. Resolving these discrepancies requires an unusual disposition of TM3 relative to the membrane-water interface and a kink in its backbone that enables bending of its C-terminal part. Binding of the substrate tetraphenylphosphonium changes the environment of spin labels and their proximity in three transmembrane helices. The underlying conformational transition involves repacking of TM1, tilting of TM2, and changes in the backbone configurations of TM3 and the adjacent loop connecting it to TM4. A dynamic apo conformation is necessary for the polyspecificity of EmrE allowing the binding of structurally diverse substrates. The flexibility of TM3 may play a critical role in movement of substrates across the membrane. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Motivation: Protein structure similarity is often measured by root mean squared deviation, global distance test score and template modeling score (TM-score). However, the scores themselves cannot provide information on how significant the structural similarity is. Also, it lacks a quantitative relation between the scores and conventional fold classifications. This article aims to answer two questions: (i) what is the statistical significance of TM-score? (ii) What is the probability of two proteins having the same fold given a specific TM-score? Results: We first made an all-to-all gapless structural match on 6684 non-homologous single-domain proteins in the PDB and found that the TM-scores follow an extreme value distribution. The data allow us to assign each TM-score a P-value that measures the chance of two randomly selected proteins obtaining an equal or higher TM-score. With a TM-score at 0.5, for instance, its P-value is 5.5Ã10-7, which means we need to consider at least 1.8 million random protein pairs to acquire a TM-score of no less than 0.5. Second, we examine the posterior probability of the same fold proteins from three datasets SCOP, CATH and the consensus of SCOP and CATH. It is found that the posterior probability from different datasets has a similar rapid phase transition around TM-score = 0.5. This finding indicates that TM-score can be used as an approximate but quantitative criterion for protein topology classification, i.e. protein pairs with a TM-score >0.5 are mostly in the same fold while those with a TM-score <0.5 are mainly not in the same fold.

abstract = {We have developed a new scoring function, the template modeling score (TM-score), to assess the quality of protein structure templates and predicted full-length models by extending the approaches used in Global Distance Test (GDT) and MaxSub. First, a protein size-dependent scale is exploited to eliminate the inherent protein size dependence of the previous scores and appropriately account for random protein structure pairs. Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR_3 and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Thus, we propose that YkbA be renamed SteT (Ser/Thr exchanger transporter). Kinetic analysis supports a sequential mechanism of exchange for SteT. Freeze-fracture analysis of purified, functionally active SteT in proteoliposomes, together with blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy of detergent-solubilized purified SteT, suggest that the transporter exists in a monomeric form. Freeze-fracture analysis showed spherical particles with a diameter of 7.4 nm. Transmission electron microscopy revealed elliptical particles (diameters 6 x 7 nm) with a distinct central depression. To our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of a prokaryotic member of the LAT family and the first structural data on an APC (amino acids, polyamines, and choline for organocations) transporter. SteT represents an excellent model to study the molecular architecture of the light subunits of heteromeric amino acid transporters and other APC transporters. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The NhaA crystal structure of Escherichia coli has become the paradigm for this class of secondary active transporters. However, structural data are only available at low pH, where NhaA is inactive. Here, we adapted hydrogen/ deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to analyze conformational changes in NhaA upon Li+ binding at physiological pH. Our analysis revealed a global conformational change in NhaA with two sets of movements around an immobile binding site. Based on these results, we propose a model for the ion translocation mechanism that explains previously controversial data for this antiporter. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of related human transporters that have been linked to various diseases.},

abstract = {Virulent enteric pathogens have developed several systems that maintain intracellular pH to survive extreme acidic conditions. One such mechanism is the exchange of arginine (Arg+) from the extracellular region with its intracellular decarboxylated form, agmatine (Agm2+). The net result of this process is the export of a virtual proton from the cytoplasm per antiport cycle. Crystal structures of the arginine/agmatine antiporter from Escherichia coli, AdiC, have been recently resolved in both the apo and Arg +-bound outward-facing conformations, which permit us to assess for the first time the time-resolved mechanisms of interactions that enable the specific antiporter functionality of AdiC. Using data from â¼1 $\mu$s of molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the protonation of Glu-208 selectively causes the dissociation and release of Agm2+, but not Arg+, to the cell exterior. The impact of Glu-208 protonation is transmitted to the substrate binding pocket via the reorientation of Ile-205 carbonyl group at the irregular portion of transmembrane (TM) helix 6. This effect, which takes place only in the subunits where Agm2+ is released, invites attention to the functional role of the unwound portion of TM helices (TM6 Trp-202-Glu-208 in AdiC) in facilitating substrate translocation, reminiscent of the behavior observed in structurally similar Na +-coupled transporters. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Alterations in LAT subfamily amino acid transport are associated with several human diseases, including cancer, aminoacidurias, and neurodegenerative conditions. Therefore, from the perspective of human health, there is considerable interest in obtaining structural information about these transporter proteins. We recently solved the crystal structure of the first LAT transporter, the bacterial alanineserine- cysteine exchanger of Carnobacterium sp AT7 (BasC). Here, we provide a complete functional characterization of detergent-purified, liposome-reconstituted BasC transporter to allow the extension of the structural insights into mechanistic understanding. BasC is a sodium- and proton-independent small neutral amino acid exchanger whose substrate and inhibitor selectivity are almost identical to those previously described for the human LAT subfamily member Asc-1. Additionally, we show that, like its human counterparts, this transporter has apparent affinity asymmetry for the intra- and extracellular substrate binding sites-a key feature in the physiological role played by these proteins. BasC is an excellent paradigm of human LAT transporters and will contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying substrate recognition and translocation at both sides of the plasma membrane.},

We have addressed this by recording uptake of endogenous substrates or the fluorescent substrate APP+ (4-(4-dimethylamino)phenyl-1-methylpyridinium) under voltage control in cells expressing DAT, NET, or SERT. We have shown that DAT and NET differ from SERT in intracellular handling of K+. In DAT and NET, substrate uptake was voltage-dependent due to the transient nature of intracellular K+ binding, which precluded K+ antiport. SERT, however, antiports K+ and achieves voltage-independent transport. Thus, there is a trade-off between maintaining constant uptake and harvesting membrane potential for concentrative power, which we conclude to occur due to subtle differences in the kinetics of co-substrate ion binding in closely related transporters.},

abstract = {We used single molecule dynamic force spectroscopy to unfold individual serine/threonine antiporters SteT from Bacillus subtilis. The unfolding force patterns revealed interactions and energy barriers that stabilized structural segments of SteT. Substrate binding did not establish strong localized interactions but appeared to be facilitated by the formation of weak interactions with several structural segments. Upon substrate binding, all energy barriers of the antiporter changed thereby describing the transition from brittle mechanical properties of SteT in the unbound state to structurally flexible conformations in the substrate bound state. The lifetime of the unbound state was much shorter than that of the substrate-bound state. This leads to the conclusion that the unbound state of SteT shows a reduced conformational flexibility to facilitate specific substrate binding and a reduced kinetic stability to enable rapid switching to the bound state. In contrast, the bound state of SteT showed an increased conformational flexibility and kinetic stability such as required to enable transport of substrate across the cell membrane. This result supports the working model of antiporters in which alternate substrate access from one to the other membrane surface occurs in the substrate-bound state. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {The human GlyT1 glycine transporter requires chloride for its function. However, the mechanism by which Cl- exerts its influence is unknown. To examine the role that Cl- plays in the transport cycle, we measured the effect of Cl- on both glycine binding and conformational changes. The ability of glycine to displace the high-affinity radioligand [3H]CHIBA-3007 required Na+ and was potentiated over 1,000-fold by Cl-. We generated GlyT1b mutants containing reactive cysteine residues in either the extracellular or cytoplasmic permeation pathways and measured changes in the reactivity of those cysteine residues as indicators of conformational changes in response to ions and substrate. Na+ increased accessibility in the extracellular pathway and decreased it in the cytoplasmic pathway, consistent with stabilizing an outward-open conformation as observed in other members of this transporter family. In the presence of Na+, both glycine and Cl- independently shifted the conformation of GlyT1b toward an outward-closed conformation. Together, Na+, glycine, and Cl- stabilized an inward-open conformation of GlyT1b. We then examined whether Cl- acts by interacting with a conserved glutamine to allow formation of an ion pair that stabilizes the closed state of the extracellular pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations of a GlyT1 homolog indicated that this ion pair is formed more frequently as that pathway closes. Mutation of the glutamine blocked the effect of Cl-, and substituting it with glutamate or lysine resulted in outward- or inward-facing transporter conformations, respectively. These results provide an unexpected insight into the role of Cl- in this family of transporters.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) are integral membrane proteins (IMP), responsible for reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. Due to challenges in production of mammalian NSS in their active form, the prokaryotic hydrophobic amino acid transporter, LeuT, served here as a steadfast model for elucidation of structure-function relationship. As NSS proteins reside within phospholipid bilayer, they require stabilization by artificial membrane systems upon their extraction. Right choice of artificial membrane system is crucial as suboptimal detergent and/or lipids can lead to destabilization or non-native stabilization. Here we study the effect of related detergents, dodecyl maltoside (DDM) and lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG), on the conformational dynamics of LeuT by global HDX-MS, in the presence of functionally relevant ligands. We observed that LeuT is more dynamic when solubilized in DDM compared to LMNG. Moreover, LeuT exhibited increased HDX in the presence of K+ compared to Na+, indicating a more dynamic conformation in the presence of K+. Upon addition of leucine, LeuT underwent additional stabilization relative to the Na+-bound state. Finally, peak broadening was observed, suggesting that LeuT undergoes slow unfolding/refolding dynamics in detergent solution. These slow dynamics were verified by local HDX, also proving that detergents modulate the rate of these dynamics. Significance: Overall, we show the efficacy of global HDX-MS to evaluate the effect of artificial membrane systems on integral membrane proteins and the importance of carefully selecting compatible detergent (and/or lipid) for the solubilization of this class of proteins.},

abstract = {We present the dynamic mechanism of concerted motions in a full-length molecular model of the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), a member of the neurotransmitter/sodium symporter (NSS) family, involved in state-to-state transitions underlying function. The findings result from an analysis of unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulation trajectories (totaling >14 $\mu$s) of the hDAT molecule immersed in lipid membrane environments with or without phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) lipids. The N-terminal region of hDAT (N-term) is shown to have an essential mechanistic role in correlated rearrangements of specific structural motifs relevant to state-to-state transitions in the hDAT. The mechanism involves PIP2-mediated electrostatic interactions between the N-term and the intracellular loops of the transporter molecule. Quantitative analyses of collective motions in the trajectories reveal that these interactions correlate with the inward-opening dynamics of hDAT and are allosterically coupled to the known functional sites of the transporter. The observed large-scale motions are enabled by specific reconfiguration of the network of ionic interactions at the intracellular end of the protein. The isomerization to the inward-facing state in hDAT is accompanied by concomitant movements in the extracellular vestibule and results in the release of an Na+ ion from the Na2 site and destabilization of the substrate dopamine in the primary substrate binding S1 site. The dynamic mechanism emerging from the findings highlights the involvement of the PIP2-regulated interactions between the N-term and the intracellular loop 4 in the functionally relevant conformational transitions that are also similar to those found to underlie state-to-state transitions in the leucine transporter (LeuT), a prototypical bacterial homologue of the NSS.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate neurotransmission by the reuptake of released neurotransmitters. This active accumulation of substrate against its concentration gradient is driven by the transmembrane Na+ gradient and requires that the transporter traverses several conformational states. LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homolog, has been crystallized in outward-open, outward-occluded, and inward-open states. Two crystal structures of another prokaryotic NSS homolog, the multihydrophobic amino acid transporter (MhsT) from Bacillus halodurans, have been resolved in novel inward-occluded states, with the extracellular vestibule closed and the intracellular portion of transmembrane segment 5 (TM5i) in either an unwound or a helical conformation. We have investigated the potential involvement of TM5i in binding and unbinding of Na2, i.e. the Na+ bound in the Na2 site, by carrying out comparative molecular dynamics simulations of the models derived from the two MhsT structures. We find that the helical TM5i conformation is associated with a higher propensity for Na2 release, which leads to the repositioning of the N terminus and transition to an inward-open state. By using comparative interaction network analysis, we also identify allosteric pathways connecting TM5i and the Na2 binding site to the extracellular and intracellular regions. Based on our combined computational and mutagenesis studies of MhsT and LeuT, we propose that TM5i plays a key role in Na2 binding and release associated with the conformational transition toward the inward-open state, a role that is likely to be shared across the NSS family.},

We investigated the functional impact of two natural anemia-causing glycine-to-arginine mutations that impaired transition metal transport in both human Nramp2 and DraNramp. The TM4 G153R mutation perturbs the closing of the outward metal-permeation pathway and alters the selectivity of the conserved metal-binding site. In contrast, the TM1a G45R mutation prevents conformational change by sterically blocking the essential movement of that helix, thus locking the transporter in an inward-facing state.},

abstract = {This study examines the conformations of the Na +/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) during sugar transport using charge and fluorescence measurements on the human SGLT1 mutant G507C expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The mutant exhibited similar steady-state and presteady-state kinetics as wild-type SGLT1, and labeling of Cys507 by tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide had no effect on kinetics. Our strategy was to record changes in charge and fluorescence in response to rapid jumps in membrane potential in the presence and absence of sugar or the competitive inhibitor phlorizin. In Na + buffer, step jumps in membrane voltage elicited presteady-state currents (charge movements) that decay to the steady state with time constants $\tau$ med (3-20 ms, medium) and $\tau$ slow (15-70 ms, slow). Concurrently, SGLT1 rhodamine fluorescence intensity increased with depolarizing and decreased with hyperpolarizing voltages ($\Delta$F). The charge vs. voltage (Q-V) and fluorescence vs. voltage ($\Delta$F-V) relations (for medium and slow components) obeyed Boltzmann relations with similar parameters: z$\delta$ (apparent valence of voltage sensor) â 1; and V 0.5 (midpoint voltage) between -15 and -40 mV. Sugar induced an inward current (Na +/glucose cotransport), and reduced maximal charge (Q max) and fluorescence ($\Delta$F max) with half-maximal concentrations (K 0.5) of 1 mM. Increasing [$\alpha$MDG] o also shifted the V 0.5 for Q and $\Delta$F to more positive values, with K 0.5's â 1 mM. The major difference between Q and $\Delta$F was that at saturating [$\alpha$MDG] o, the presteady-state current (and Q max) was totally abolished, whereas $\Delta$F max was only reduced 50%. Phlorizin reduced both Q max and $\Delta$F max (K i â 0.4 $\mu$M), with no changes in V 0.5's or relaxation time constants. Simulations using an eight-state kinetic model indicate that external sugar increases the occupancy probability of inward-facing conformations at the expense of outward-facing conformations. The simulations predict, and we have observed experimentally, that presteady-state currents are blocked by saturating sugar, but not the changes in fluorescence. Thus we have isolated an electroneutral conformational change that has not been previously described. This rate-limiting step at maximal inward Na +/sugar cotransport (saturating voltage and external Na + and sugar concentrations) is the slow release of Na + from the internal surface of SGLT1. The high affinity blocker phlorizin locks the cotransporter in an inactive conformation. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

abstract = {The Na+-glucose cotransporter hSGLT1 is a member of a class of membrane proteins that harness Na+ electrochemical gradients to drive uphill solute transport. Although hSGLT1 belongs to one gene family (SLC5), recent structural studies of bacterial Na+ cotransport-ers have shown that Na+ transporters in different gene families have the same structural fold. We have constructed homology models of hSGLT1 in two conformations, the inward-facing occluded (based on vSGLT) and the outward open conformations (based on Mhp1), mutated in turn each of the conserved gates and ligand binding residues, expressed the SGLT1 mutants in Xenopus oocytes, and determined the functional consequences using biophysical and biochemical assays. The results establish that mutating the ligand binding residues produces profound changes in the ligand affinity (the half-saturation concentration, K0.5); e.g., mutating sugar binding residues increases the glucose K0.5 by up to three orders of magnitude. Mutation of the external gate residues increases the Na+ to sugar transport stoichiometry, demonstrating that these residues are critical for efficient cotransport. The changes in phlorizin inhibition constant (Ki) are proportional to the changes in sugar K0.5, except in the case of F101C, where phlorizin K increases by orders of magnitude without a change in glucose K0.5. We conclude that glucose and phlorizin occupy the same binding site and that F101 is involved in binding to the phloretin group of the inhibitor. Substituted-cysteine accessibility methods show that the cysteine residues at the position of the gates and sugar binding site are largely accessible only to external hydrophilic methanethiosulfonate reagents in the presence of external Na+, demonstrating that the external sugar (and phlorizin) binding vestibule is opened by the presence of external Na+ and closes after the binding of sugar and phlorizin. Overall, the present results provide a bridge between kinetics and structural studies of cotransporters. {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Proximity relationships within three doubly spin-labeled variants of the Na+/proline transporter PutP of Escherichia coli were studied by means of four-pulse double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy. The large value of 4.8 nm for the interspin distance determined between positions 107 in loop 4 and 223 in loop 7 strongly supports the idea of these positions being located on opposite sides of the membrane. Significant smaller values of between 1.8 and 2.5 nm were found for the average interspin distances between spin labels attached to the cytoplasmic loops 2 and 4 (position 37 and 107) and loops 2 and 6 (position 37 and 187). The large distance distribution widths visible in the pair correlation functions reveal a high flexibility of the studied loop regions. An increase of the distance between positions 37 and 187 upon Na+ binding suggests ligand-induced structural alterations of PutP. The results demonstrate that four-pulse double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy is a powerful means to investigate the structure and conformational changes of integral membrane proteins reconstituted in proteoliposomes.},

abstract = {Background: Much of the structure-based mechanistic understandings of the function of SLC6A neurotransmitter transporters emerged from the study of their bacterial LeuT-fold homologs. It has become evident, however, that structural differences such as the long N- and C-termini of the eukaryotic neurotransmitter transporters are involved in an expanded set of functional properties to the eukaryotic transporters. These functional properties are not shared by the bacterial homologs, which lack the structural elements that appeared later in evolution. However, mechanistic insights into some of the measured functional properties of the eukaryotic transporters that have been suggested to involve these structural elements are sparse or merely descriptive. Results: To learn how the structural elements added in evolution enable mechanisms of the eukaryotic transporters in ways not shared with their bacterial LeuT-like homologs, we focused on the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) as a prototype. We present the results of a study employing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and comparative Markov state model analysis of experimentally determined properties of the wild-type and mutant hDAT constructs. These offer a quantitative outline of mechanisms in which a rich spectrum of interactions of the hDAT N-terminus and C-terminus contribute to the regulation of transporter function (e.g., by phosphorylation) and/or to entirely new phenotypes (e.g., reverse uptake (efflux)) that were added in evolution. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with the proposal that the size of eukaryotic neurotransmitter transporter termini increased during evolution to enable more functions (e.g., efflux) not shared with the bacterial homologs. The mechanistic explanations for the experimental findings about the modulation of function in DAT, the serotonin transporter, and other eukaryotic transporters reveal separate roles for the distal and proximal segments of the much larger N-terminus in eukaryotic transporters compared to the bacterial ones. The involvement of the proximal and distal segments - such as the role of the proximal segment in sustaining transport in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-depleted membranes and of the distal segment in modulating efflux - may represent an evolutionary adaptation required for the function of eukaryotic transporters expressed in various cell types of the same organism that differ in the lipid composition and protein complement of their membrane environment.},

abstract = {With respect to the functional importance attributed to the N-terminal part of the Na+/proline transporter of Escherichia coli (PutP), we report here on the structural arrangement and functional dynamics of transmembrane domains (TMs) II and III and the adjoining loop regions. Information on membrane topography was obtained by analyzing the residual mobility of site- specifically-attached nitroxide spin label and by determination of collision frequencies of the nitroxide with oxygen and a polar metal ion complex using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The studies suggest that amino acids Phe45, Ser50, Ser54, Trp59, and Met62 are part of TM II while Gly39 and Arg40 are located at a membrane-water interface probably forming the cytoplasmic cap of the TM. Also Ala67 and Glu75 are at a membrane-water interface, suggesting a location close to the periplasmic ends of TMs II and III, respectively. Ser71 between these residues is clearly in a water-exposed loop (periplasmic loop 3). Spin labels attached to positions 80, 86, and 91 show EPR properties typical for a TM location (TM III). Leu97 may be part of a structured loop region while Ala107 is clearly located in a water-exposed loop (cytoplasmic loop 4). Finally, spin labels attached to the positions of Asp33 and Leu37 are clearly on the surface of the transporter and are directed into an apolar environment. These findings strongly support the recently proposed 13-helix model of PutP [Jung, H., Rubenhagen, R., Tebbe, S., Leifker, K., Tholema, N., Quick, M., and Schmid, R. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 26400-26407] and suggest that TMs II and HI of the transporter are formed by amino acids Ser41 to Gly66 and Ser76 to Gly95, respectively. In addition to the topology analysis, it is shown that binding of Na+ and/or proline to the transporter alters the mobility of the nitroxide group at the positions of Leu37 and Phe45. From these findings, it is concluded that binding of the ligands induces conformational alterations of PutP that involve at least parts of TM II and the preceding cytoplasmic loop.},

abstract = {The large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, or SLC7A5) is a sodium- and pH-independent transporter, which supplies essential amino acids (e.g., leucine, phenylalanine) to cells. It plays an important role at the BloodâBrain Barrier (BBB) where it facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones, pharmaceuticals (e.g., L-DOPA, gabapentin), and metabolites into the brain. Moreover, its expression is highly upregulated in various types of human cancer that are characterized by an intense demand for amino acids for growth and proliferation. Therefore, LAT1 is believed to be an important drug target for cancer treatment. With the crystallization of the arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC) from Escherichia Coli, numerous homology models of LAT1 have been built to elucidate the substrate binding site, ligandâtransporter interaction, and structureâfunction relationship. The use of these models in combination with molecular docking and experimental testing has identified novel chemotypes of ligands of LAT1. Here, we highlight the structure, function, transport mechanism, and homology modeling of LAT1. Additionally, results from structureâfunction studies performed on LAT1 are addressed, which have enhanced our knowledge of the mechanism of substrate binding and translocation. This is followed by a discussion on ligand- and structure-based approaches, with an emphasis on elucidating the molecular basis of LAT1 inhibition.

abstract = {Background LAT1 (SLC7A5) is the transport competent unit of the heterodimer formed with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2). It catalyzes antiport of His and some neutral amino acids such as Ile, Leu, Val, Cys, Met, Gln and Phe thus being involved in amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, LAT1 is over-expressed in many human cancers that are characterized by increased demand of amino acids. Therefore LAT1 was recently acknowledged as a novel target for cancer therapy. However, knowledge on molecular mechanism of LAT1 transport is still scarce. Methods Combined approaches of bioinformatics, site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification, and transport assay in proteoliposomes, have been adopted to unravel dark sides of human LAT1 structure/function relationships. Results It has been demonstrated that residues F252, S342, C335 are crucial for substrate recognition and C407 plays a minor role. C335 and C407 cannot be targeted by SH reagents. The transporter has a preferential dimeric structure and catalyzes an antiport reaction which follows a simultaneous random mechanism. Conclusions Critical residues of the substrate binding site of LAT1 have been probed. This site is not freely accessible by molecules other than substrate. Similarly to LeuT, K+ has some regulatory properties on LAT1. General significance The collected data represent a solid basis for deciphering molecular mechanism underlying LAT1 function.},

abstract = {We examined the relationship between transmembrane domain (TM) 10 and TM11/12 in NKCC1, testing homology models based on the structure of AdiC in the same transporter superfamily. We hypothesized that introduced cysteine pairs would be close enough for disulfide formation and would alter transport function: indeed, evidence for cross-link formation with low micromolar concentrations of copper phenanthroline or iodine was found in 3 of 8 initially tested pairs and in 1 of 26 additionally tested pairs. Inhibition of transport was observed with copper phenanthroline and iodine treatment of P676C/A734C and I677C/A734C, consistent with the proximity of these residues and with movement of TM10 during the occlusion step of ion transport. We also found Cu 2+ inhibition of the single-cysteine mutant A675C, suggesting that this residue and Met382 of TM3 are involved in a Cu 2+-binding site. Surprisingly, cross-linking of P676C/I730C was found to prevent rapid deactivation of the transporter while not affecting the dephosphorylation rate, thus uncoupling the phosphorylation and activation steps. Consistent with this, (a) cross-linking of P676C/I730C was dependent on activation state, and (b) mutants lacking the phosphoregulatory domain could still be activated by cross-linking. These results suggest a model of NKCC activation that involves movement of TM12 relative to TM10, which is likely tied to movement of the large C terminus, a process somehow triggered by phosphorylation of the regulatory domain in the N terminus. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Na+/glucose cotransport is abolished in the TMR6M-labeled mutant, but the protein binds Na+ and sugar [Loo et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95, 7789-7794]. Under voltage clamp the fluorescence of labeled Q457C was dependent on external cations. Increasing [Na+] increased fluorescence with a Hill coefficient of 2 and half-maximal concentration (K0.5Na) of 49 mM at -90 mV. Li+ also increased fluorescence, whereas choline, tetraethylammonium, and N-methyl-D-glucamine did not. Fluorescence was increased by sugars with specificity: methyl $\alpha$-D-glucopyranoside > D-glucose > D-galactose >> D-mannitol. Voltage-jump experiments (in 100 mM NaCl buffer in absence of sugar) elicited parallel changes in pre-steady-state charge movement and fluorescence. Charge vs voltage and fluorescence vs voltage curves followed Boltzmann relations with the same median voltage (V0.5 = -50 mV), but the apparent valence was 1 for charge movement and 0.4 for fluorescence. V0.5 for fluorescence and charge movement was shifted by - 100 mV per 10-fold decrease in [Na+]. Under Na+-free conditions, there was a voltage-dependent change in fluorescence. Voltage-jump experiments showed that the maximal change in fluorescence increased 20% with sugar. These results indicate that Na+, sugar, and membrane voltage change the local environment of the fluorophore at Q457C. Our interpretation of these results is (1) the conformational change of the empty transporter is voltage dependent, (2) two Na+ ions can bind cooperatively to the protein before sugar, and (3) sugar binding induces a conformational change.},

abstract = {Plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters determine in part the concentration, time course, and diffusion of extracellular transmitter. Much has been learned about how substrate translocation through the transporter occurs; however, the precise way in which transporter structure maps onto transporter function has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, biochemical and electrophysiological approaches were used to test the hypothesis that intracellular domains of the rat brain GABA transporter (GAT1) contribute to the transport process. Injection of a peptide corresponding to the presumed fourth intracellular loop of the transporter (IL4) into oocytes expressing GAT1 greatly reduced both forward and reverse transport and reduced the transport rate in a dose-dependent manner. Coinjection of the IL4 peptide with a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GAT1 reversed the IL4-mediated inhibition; this reversal, and direct binding between these two domains, was prevented by mutagenesis of charged residues in either the IL4 or N-terminal domains. Furthermore, syntaxin 1A, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein that inhibits GAT1 transport rates via interactions with the N-terminal tail of GAT1 was unable to regulate the GAT1 IL4 mutant. Together, these data suggest a model in which the GAT1 IL4 domain serves as a barrier for transport, and this barrier can be regulated through intra-molecular and inter-molecular interactions.},

abstract = {Increases in the environmental osmolarity are key determinants for the growth of microorganisms. To ensure a physiologically acceptable level of cellular hydration and turgor at high osmolarity, many bacteria accumulate compatible solutes. Osmotically controlled uptake systems allow the scavenging of these compounds from scarce environmental sources as effective osmoprotectants. A number of these systems belong to the BCCT family (betaine-choline-carnitine-transporter), sodium- or proton-coupled transporters (e.g. BetP and BetT respectively) that are ubiquitous in microorganisms. The BCCT family also contains CaiT, an l-carnitine/-butyrobetaine antiporter that is not involved in osmotic stress responses. The glycine betaine transporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum is a representative for osmoregulated symporters of the BCCT family and functions both as an osmosensor and osmoregulator. The crystal structure of BetP in an occluded conformation in complex with its substrate glycine betaine and two crystal structures of CaiT in an inward-facing open conformation in complex with l-carnitine and -butyrobetaine were reported recently. These structures and the wealth of biochemical data on the activity control of BetP in response to osmotic stress enable a correlation between the sensing of osmotic stress by a transporter protein with the ensuing regulation of transport activity. Molecular determinants governing the high-affinity binding of the compatible solutes by BetP and CaiT, the coupling in symporters and antiporters, and the osmoregulatory properties are discussed in detail for BetP and various BCCT carriers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) emerged as a tool for biochemistry and structural biology around 25 years ago. It has since become a key approach for studying protein dynamics, protein-ligand interactions, membrane proteins and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In HDX labeling, proteins are exposed to deuterated solvent (usually D2O) for a variable âlabeling time' resulting in isotope exchange of unprotected labile protons on the amide backbone and amino acid side chains. By comparing the levels of deuterium uptake in different regions of a protein, information on conformational and dynamic changes in the system can be acquired. When coupled with MS, HDX is suitable for probing allosteric effects in catalysis and ligand binding, epitope mapping, validation of biosimilars, drug candidate screening and mapping membrane-protein interactions among many other bioanalytical applications. This review introduces HDX-MS via a brief description of HDX-MS development, followed by an overview of HDX theory and ultimately an outline of methods and procedures involved in performing HDX-MS experiments.},

abstract = {The nucleobase cation symporter-1 (NCS1) family of secondary active transport proteins comprises over 2500 sequenced members from bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants. NCS1 proteins use a proton or sodium gradient to drive inward cellular transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleobases and nucleosides, hydantoins and related compounds. The structural organization, substrate binding residues and molecular mechanism of NCS1 proteins are defined by crystal structures of sodium-coupled hydantoin transporter, Mhp1. Plant proteins are most closely related to bacterial/archaeal proteins and the distinct Fur-type and Fcy-type fungal proteins and plant proteins originated through independent horizontal transfers from prokaryotes. Analyses of 25 experimentally characterized proteins reveal high substrate specificity in bacterial proteins, distinct non-overlapping specificities in Fur-type and Fcy-type fungal proteins and broad specificity in plant proteins. Possible structural explanations are identified for differences in substrate specificity between bacterial proteins, whilst specificities of other proteins cannot be predicted by simple sequence comparisons. Specificity appears to be species specific and determined by combinations of effects dictated by multiple residues in the major substrate binding site and gating domains. This is an exploratory research review of evolutionary relationships, function and structural organization, molecular mechanism and origins of substrate specificity in NCS1 proteins and avenues of future direction.},

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates the presence of growth factors, energy levels, glucose and amino acids to modulate metabolic status and cellular responses. mTORC1 is activated at the surface of lysosomes by the RAG GTPases and the Ragulator complex through a not fully understood mechanism monitoring amino acid availability in the lysosomal lumen and involving the vacuolar H +-ATPase. Here we describe the uncharacterized human member 9 of the solute carrier family 38 (SLC38A9) as a lysosomal membrane-resident protein competent in amino acid transport. Extensive functional proteomic analysis established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery. Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal, whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation. Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing machinery that controls the activation of mTOR.},

SERT belongs to the SLC6 family of ion-coupled transporters and is structurally related to several other transporter families. SERT was studied in the 1970s and 1980s using membrane vesicles isolated from blood platelets. These studies led to a proposed stoichiometry of transport that has been challenged by high-resolution structures of SERT and its homologues and by studies of SERT electrophysiology. Here, we review the original evidence alongside more recent structural and electrophysiological evidence.

How the LFC is disassembled upon amino acid refeeding is an outstanding question.

abstract = {Background The mammalian neurotransmitter transporters are complex proteins playing a central role in synaptic transmission between neurons by rapid reuptake of neurotransmitters. The proteins which transport dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin belong to the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters (NSS). Due to their important role, dysfunctions are associated with several psychiatric and neurological diseases and they also serve as targets for a wide range of therapeutic and illicit drugs. Despite the central physiological and pharmacological importance, direct evidence on structure-function relationships on mammalian NSS proteins has so far been unsuccessful. The crystal structure of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, has been a turning point in structural investigations. Scope of review To provide an update on what is known about the binding sites for substrates and inhibitors in the LeuT. The different binding modes and binding sites will be discussed with special emphasis on the possible existence of a second substrate binding site. It is the goal to give an insight into how investigations on ligand binding in LeuT have provided basic knowledge about transporter conformations and translocation mechanism which can pave the road for a deeper understanding of drug binding and function of the mammalian transporters. Major conclusions The LeuT is a suitable model for the structural investigation of NSS proteins including the possible location of drug binding sites. It is still debated whether the LeuT is a suitable model for the molecular mechanisms behind substrate translocation. General significance Structure and functional aspects of NSS proteins are central for understanding synaptic transmission. With the purification and crystallization of LeuT as well as the dopamine transporter from Drosophila melanogaster, the application of biophysical methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy, neutron- or x-ray scattering and NMR for understanding its function becomes increasingly available.

A dc-dc converter is used to regulate the output voltage which depends on the type of dc to dc converter. Lead acid batteries are used as the electric energy storage for the PV system to use electrical energy in the absence of sunlight. The principle operation of the system and the feasibility of using it for rural area with no power grid have been studied. For this project, a mount tracker was constructed that enabled the solar panel to be placed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 degree angles in order to determine which angle and what time provides the optimum voltage.

abstract = {The Na+-coupled betaine symporter BetP senses changes in the membrane state and increasing levels of cytoplasmic K+ during hyperosmotic stress latter via its C-terminal domain and regulates transport activity according to both stimuli. This intriguing sensing and regulation behavior of BetP was intensively studied in the past. It was shown by several biochemical studies that activation and regulation depends crucially on the lipid composition of the surrounding membrane. In fact, BetP is active and regulated only when negatively charged lipids are present. Recent structural studies have revealed binding of phosphatidylglycerol lipids to functional important parts of Bet P, suggesting afunctional role of lipid interactions. However, a regulatory role of lipid interactions could only be speculated from the snapshot provided by the crystal structure. Here, we investigate the nature of lipid-protein interactions of BetP reconstituted in closely packed two-dimensional crystals of negatively charged lipids and probed at the molecular level with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR data indicate that K+ binding weakens the interaction of BetP especially with the anionic lipid head groups. We suggest a regulation mechanism in which lipid-protein interactions, especially with the C-terminal domain and the functional important gating helices transmembrane helice 3 (TMH3) and TMH12, confine BetP to its down-regulated transport state. As BetP is also activated by changes in the physical state of the membrane, our results point toward a more general mechanism of how active transport can be modified by dynamic lipid-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Serotonin transporter (SERT) is responsible for reuptake and recycling of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) after its exocytotic release during neurotransmission. Mutations in human SERT are associated with psychiatric disorders and autism. Some of these mutations affect the regulation of SERT activity by cGMP-dependent phosphorylation. Here we provide direct evidence that this phosphorylation occurs at Thr276, predicted to lie near the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 5 (TM5). Using membranes from HeLa cells expressing SERT and intact rat basophilic leukemia cells, we show that agents such as Na+ and cocaine that stabilize outward-open conformations of SERT decreased phosphorylation and agents that stabilize inward-open conformations (e.g., 5-HT, ibogaine) increased phosphorylation. The opposing effects of the inhibitors cocaine and ibogaine were each reversed by an excess of the other inhibitor. Inhibition of phosphorylation by Na+ and stimulation by ibogaine occurred at concentrations that induced outward opening and inward opening, respectively, as measured by the accessibility of cysteine residues in the extracellular and cytoplasmic permeation pathways, respectively. The results are consistent with a mechanism of SERT regulation that is activated by the transport of 5-HT, which increases the level of inward-open SERT and may lead to unwinding of the TM5 helix to allow phosphorylation.},

abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that responds to multiple environmental cues. Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase-dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb. Here, we identify SLC38A9, an uncharacterized protein with sequence similarity to amino acid transporters, as a lysosomal transmembrane protein that interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and Ragulator in an amino acid-sensitive fashion. SLC38A9 transports arginine with a high Michaelis constant, and loss of SLC38A9 represses mTORC1 activation by amino acids, particularly arginine. Overexpression of SLC38A9 or just its Ragulator-binding domain makes mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation but not to Rag activity.Thus, SLC38A9 functions upstream of the Rag GTPases and is an excellent candidate for being an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.},

abstract = {Amphetamines (AMPHs) are potent psychostimulants that are widely used and abused, with profound medical and societal impact. Their actions at dopaminergic neurons are thought to mediate their therapeutic efficacy as well as their liability for abuse and dependence. AMPHs target the dopamine transporter (DAT), the plasmalemmal membrane protein that mediates the inactivation of released dopamine (DA) through its reuptake. AMPHs act as substrates for DAT and are known to cause mobilization of dopamine (DA) to the cell exterior via DAT-mediated reverse transport (efflux). It has become increasingly evident that the mechanisms that regulate AMPH-induced DA efflux are distinct from those that regulate DA uptake. Central to these mechanisms is the phosphorylation of the DAT amino (N)-terminus, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to facilitate DAT-mediated DA efflux, without impacting other aspects of DAT physiology. This review aims to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding DAT N-terminal phosphorylation and its regulation by protein modulators and the membrane microenvironment. A better understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic approaches that interfere selectively with the pharmacological effects of AMPHs without altering the physiological function of DAT.},

abstract = {The Na+/solute symporter family (SSF, TC No. 2.A.21) contains more than 40 members of pro- and eukaryotic origin. Besides their sequence similarity, the transporters share the capability to utilize the free energy stored in electrochemical Na+ gradients for the accumulation of solutes. As part of catabolic pathways most of the transporters are most probably involved in the acquisition of nutrients. Some transporters play a role in osmoadaptation. With a high resolution structure still missing, a combination of genetic, protein chemical and spectroscopic methods has been used to gain new insights into the structure and molecular mechanism of action of the transport proteins. The studies suggest a common 13-helix motif for all members of the SSF according to which the N-terminus is located in the periplasm and the C-terminus is directed into the cytoplasm (except for proteins containing a N- or C-terminal extension). Furthermore, an amino acid substitution analysis of the Na+/proline transporter (PutP) of Escherichia coli, a member of the SSF, has identified regions of particular functional importance. For example, amino acids of TM II of PutP proved to be critical for high affinity binding of Na+ and proline. In addition, it was shown that ligand binding induces widespread conformational alterations in the transport protein. Taken together, the studies substantiate the common idea that Na+/solute symport is the result of a series of ligand-induced structural changes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

LAT1 is overexpressed in many types of tumors and mediates the transfer of drugs and hormones across the blood-brain barrier. Thus, LAT1 is considered as a drug target for cancer treatment and may be exploited for drug delivery into the brain. Here, we synthesized three potent inhibitors of human LAT1, which inhibit transport of leucine with IC50 values between 100 and 250 nM, and solved the cryo-EM structures of the corresponding LAT1-4F2hc complexes with these inhibitors bound at resolution of up to 2.7 or 2.8 {\AA}. The protein assumes an outward-facing occluded conformation, with the inhibitors bound in the classical substrate binding pocket, but with their tails wedged between the substrate binding site and TM10 of LAT1. We also solved the complex structure of LAT1-4F2hc with 3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine (Diiodo-Tyr) at 3.4 {\AA} overall resolution, which revealed a different inhibition mechanism and might represent an intermediate conformation between the outward-facing occluded state mentioned above and the outward-open state. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the outward-facing conformation is revealed for the HAT family. Our results unveil more important insights into the working mechanisms of HATs and provide a structural basis for future drug design.},

abstract = {The human GlyT1 glycine transporter requires chloride for its function. However, the mechanism by which Cl â exerts its influence is unknown. To examine the role that Cl â plays in the transport cycle, we measured the effect of Cl â on both glycine binding and conformational changes. The ability of glycine to displace the high-affinity radioligand [ 3 H]CHIBA-3007 required Na + and was po-tentiated over 1,000-fold by Cl â. We generated GlyT1b mutants containing reactive cysteine residues in either the extracellular or cytoplasmic permeation pathways and measured changes in the reactivity of those cysteine residues as indicators of conformational changes in response to ions and substrate. Na + increased accessibility in the extracellular pathway and decreased it in the cytoplasmic pathway, consistent with stabilizing an outward-open conforma-tion as observed in other members of this transporter family. In the presence of Na + , both glycine and Cl â independently shifted the conformation of GlyT1b toward an outward-closed conforma-tion. Together, Na + , glycine, and Cl â stabilized an inward-open con-formation of GlyT1b. We then examined whether Cl â acts by interacting with a conserved glutamine to allow formation of an ion pair that stabilizes the closed state of the extracellular pathway.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the representation of a multivariate sample of size n as points P1, P2, {\ldots}, Pn in a Euclidean space. The interpretation of the distance $\Delta$(Pi, Pj) between the ith and jth members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both Q and R techniques. When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinrates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as D2 with a singular dispersion matrix.},

abstract = {Flexible proteins serve vital roles in a multitude of biological processes. However, determining their full conformational ensembles is extremely difficult because this requires detailed knowledge about the heterogeneity of the protein's degrees of freedom. Label-based experiments such as double electron-electron resonance (DEER) are very useful in studying flexible proteins, as they provide distributional data on heterogeneity. These experiments are typically performed separately, so information about correlation between distributions is lost. We have developed a method to recover correlation information using nonequilibrium work estimates in molecular dynamics refinement. We tested this method on a simple model of an alternating-access transporter for which the true joint distributions are known, and it successfully recovered the true joint distribution. We also applied our method to the protein syntaxin-1a, where it discarded physically implausible conformations. Our method thus provides a way to recover correlation structure in separate experimental measurements of conformational ensembles and refines the resulting structural ensemble.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of ecological structures originates either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes. In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Amino acid transport into the cell is often coupled to the proton electrochemical gradient, as found in the solute carrier 36 family of proton-coupled amino acid transporters. Although no structure of a human proton-coupled amino acid transporter exists, the crystal structure of a related homolog from bacteria, GkApcT, has recently been solved in an inward-occluded state and allows an opportunity to examine how protons are coupled to amino acid transport. Our working hypothesis is that release of the amino acid substrate is facilitated by the deprotonation of a key glutamate residue (E115) located at the bottom of the binding pocket, which forms part of the intracellular gate, allowing the protein to transition from an inward-occluded to an inward-open conformation. During unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we observed a transition from the inward-occluded state captured in the crystal structure to a much more open state, which we consider likely to be representative of the inward-open state associated with substrate release. To explore this and the role of protons in these transitions, we have used umbrella sampling to demonstrate that the transition from inward occluded to inward open is more energetically favorable when E115 is deprotonated. That E115 is likely to be protonated in the inward-occluded state and deprotonated in the inward-open state is further confirmed via the use of absolute binding free energies. Finally, we also show, via the use of absolute binding free energy calculations, that the affinity of the protein for alanine is very similar regardless of either the conformational state or the protonation of E115, presumably reflecting the fact that all the key interactions are deep within the binding cavity. Together, our results give a detailed picture of the role of protons in driving one of the major transitions in this transporter.},

abstract = {Aquaporins (AQPs) are members of the Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) family that can transport water or glycerol, as well as other compounds. The rationale for substrate selectivity at the structural level is still incompletely understood. The information present in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) can help identify both structural and functional features, especially the complex networks of interactions responsible for water or glycerol selectivity. Herein, we have used the method of Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) to identify co-evolving pairs of residues in two separate groups of sequences predicted to correspond to water or glycerol transporters. Differentially co-evolved pairs between the two groups were tested by their efficacy in correctly classifying a training set of MSAs, and binary classifiers were built with these pairs. Up to 50% of the residues found in hundreds of binary classifiers corresponded to only ten positions in the MSA of aquaporins. Most of these residues are close to the lining of the aquaporin pore and have been identified previously as important for selectivity. Therefore, this method can shed light on the residues that are important for substrate selectivity of aquaporins and other proteins. SCA requires a very large sequence dataset with relatively low homology amongst its members, and these requirements are met by aquaporins. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These heptahelical receptors are proposed to function as ligand-gated ion channels and/or to act metabotropically as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Resolving their signalling mechanism has been hampered by the lack of tertiary structural information and primary sequence similarity to other proteins. We use amino acid evolutionary covariation across these ORs to define restraints on structural proximity of residue pairs, which permit de novo generation of three-dimensional models. The validity of our analysis is supported by the location of functionally important residues in highly constrained regions of the protein. Importantly, insect OR models exhibit a distinct transmembrane domain packing arrangement to that of canonical GPCRs, establishing the structural unrelatedness of these receptor families. The evolutionary couplings and models predict odour binding and ion conduction domains, and provide a template for rationale structure-activity dissection.},

abstract = {In a number of cases, the function of membrane proteins appears to require the presence of specific lipid species in the bilayer. We have shown that the secondary multidrug transporter LmrP requires the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), as its replacement by phosphatidylcholine (PC) inhibits transport activity and directly affects its structure, although the underlying mechanism was unknown. Here, we show that the effect of PE on the structure and the function of LmrP is mediated by interactions between the lipid headgroup and the protein. We used methyl-PE and dimethyl-PE analogs of PE to show that only replacement of the three hydrogens by methyl moieties leads to changes in the biochemical and biophysical properties of the reconstituted protein. This suggests that LmrP does not depend on the bulk properties of the phospholipids tested but solely on the hydrogen bonding ability of the headgroup. We then show that a single point mutation in LmrP, D68C, is sufficient to recapitulate precisely every biochemical and biophysical effect observed when PE is replaced by PC, including energy transfer between the protein tryptophan residues and the lipid headgroups. We conclude that the negatively charged Asp-68 is likely to participate in the interaction with PE and that such interaction is required for proton gradient sensing, substrate binding, and transport. Because Asp-68 belongs to a highly conserved motif in the Major Facilitator Superfamily (which includes LacY and EmrD), this interaction might be a general feature of these transporters that is involved in proton gradient sensing and lipid dependence. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

We determined the crystal structure of LmrP in a ligand-bound outward-open state and observed an embedded lipid in the binding cavity of LmrP, an observation supported by native mass spectrometry analyses. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the anionic lipid stabilizes the observed ligand-bound structure. Mutants engineered to disrupt binding of the embedded lipid display reduced transport of some, but not all, antibiotic substrates. Our results suggest that a lipid within the binding cavity could provide a malleable hydrophobic component that allows adaptation to the presence of different substrates, helping to explain the broad specificity of this protein and possibly other multidrug transporters.},

abstract = {Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful method for unraveling structures and dynamics of biomolecules. Out of the EPR tool box, Pulsed Electron-Electron Double Resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR or DEER) enables one to resolve such structures by providing distances between spin centers on the nanometer scale. Most commonly, both spin centers are spin labels or one is a spin label and the other is a paramagnetic metal ion, cluster, amino acid or cofactor radical. Often, the translation of the measured distances into structures is complicated by the long and flexible linker connecting the spin center of the spin label with the biomolecule. Nowadays, this challenge is overcome by computational methods but the currently available approaches have a rather large mean error of roughly 2-3 {\AA}. Here, the new GFN-FF general force-field is combined with the fully automated Conformer Rotamer Ensemble Search Tool (CREST) [P. Pracht et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, 22, 7169-7192] to generate conformer ensembles of the R1 side chain (methanthiosulfonate spin label (MTSL) covalently bound to a cysteine) in several cysteine mutants of azurin and T4 lysozyme. In order to determine the Cu2+-R1 and R1-R1 distance distributions, GFN-FF based MD simulations were carried out starting from the most probable R1 conformers found by CREST. The deviation between theory and experiment in mean inter-spin distances was 0.98 {\AA} on average for the mutants of azurin (1.84 {\AA} for T4 lysozyme) and the right modality was obtained. The error of the most probable distances for each mode was only 0.76 {\AA} in the case of azurin. This CREST/MD procedure does thus enable precise distance-to-structure translations and provides a means to disentangle label from protein conformers.},

The latter two functions are thought to involve the lumenal loop and the N-terminal domain. Their structure and mobility in an aqueous environment are only partially known. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has been used to measure the structure of these hydrophilic protein domains in detergent-solubilized LHCII. A new technique is introduced to prepare LHCII trimers in which only one monomer is spin-labeled. These heterogeneous trimers allow to measure intra-molecular distances within one LHCII monomer in the context of a trimer by using double electron-electron resonance (DEER). These data together with data from electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) allowed to model the N-terminal protein section, which has not been resolved in current crystal structures, and the lumenal loop domain. The N-terminal domain covers only a restricted area above the superhelix in LHCII, which is consistent with the "Velcro" hypothesis to explain thylakoid grana stacking (Standfuss, J., van Terwisscha Scheltinga, A.

abstract = {The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter lactose permease (LacY) alternates between cytoplasmic and periplasmic open conformations to co-transport a sugar molecule together with a proton across the plasma membrane. Indirect experimental evidence suggested the existence of an occluded transition intermediate of LacY, which would prevent leaking of the proton gradient. As no experimental structure is known, the conformational transition is not fully understood in atomic detail. We simulated transition events from a cytoplasmic open conformation to a periplasmic open conformation with the dynamic importance sampling molecular dynamics method and observed occluded intermediates. Analysis of water permeation pathways and the electrostatic free-energy landscape of a solvated proton indicated that the occluded state contains a solvated central cavity inaccessible from either side of the membrane. We propose a pair of geometric order parameters that capture the state of the pathway through the MFS transporters as shown by a survey of available crystal structures and models. We present a model for the occluded state of apo-LacY, which is similar to the occluded crystal structures of the MFS transporters EmrD, PepTSo, NarU, PiPT and XylE. Our simulations are consistent with experimental double electron spin-spin distance measurements that have been interpreted to show occluded conformations. During the simulations, a salt bridge that has been postulated to be involved in driving the conformational transition formed. Our results argue against a simple rigid-body domain motion as implied by a strict "rocker-switch mechanism" and instead hint at an intricate coupling between two flexible gates. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Owing to their plasticity, intrinsically disordered and multidomain proteins require descriptions based on multiple conformations, thus calling for techniques and analysis tools that are capable of dealing with conformational ensembles rather than a single protein structure. Here, we introduce DEER-PREdict, a software program to predict Double Electron-Electron Resonance distance distributions as well as Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement rates from ensembles of protein conformations. DEER-PREdict uses an established rotamer library approach to describe the paramagnetic probes which are bound covalently to the protein.DEER-PREdict has been designed to operate efficiently on large conformational ensembles, such as those generated by molecular dynamics simulation, to facilitate the validation or refinement of molecular models as well as the interpretation of experimental data. The performance and accuracy of the software is demonstrated with experimentally characterized protein systems: HIV-1 protease, T4 Lysozyme and Acyl-CoA-binding protein. DEER-PREdict is open source (GPLv3) and available at github.com/KULL-Centre/ DEERpredict and as a Python PyPI package pypi.org/project/DEERPREdict.},

abstract = {Synaptotagmin 1 (syt1) is a synaptic vesicle membrane protein that functions as the Ca2+ sensor in neuronal exocytosis. Here, site-directed spin labeling was used to generate models for the solution and membrane-bound structures of a soluble fragment of syt1 containing its two C2 domains, C2A and C2B. In solution, distance restraints between the two C2 domains of syt1 were measured using double electron-electron resonance and used in a simulated annealing routine to generate models for the structure of the tandem C2A-C2B fragment. The data indicate that the two C2 domains are flexibly linked and do not interact with each other in solution, with or without Ca2+. However, the favored orientation is one where the Ca2+-binding loops are oriented in opposite directions. A similar approach was taken for membrane-associated C2A-C2B, combining both distances and bilayer depth restraints with simulated annealing. The restraints can only be satisfied if the Ca2+ and membrane-binding surfaces of the domains are oriented in opposite directions so that C2A and C2B are docked to opposing bilayers. The result suggests that syt1 functions to bridge across the vesicle and plasma membrane surfaces in a Ca2+-dependent manner. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Synaptotagmin 1 (syt1) functions as a Ca2+-sensor for neuronal exocytosis. Here, site-directed spin labeling was used to examine the complex formed between a soluble fragment of syt1, which contains its two C2 domains, and the neuronal core soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex. Changes in electron paramagnetic resonance lineshape and accessibility for spin-labeled syt1 mutants indicate that in solution, the assembled core SNARE complex contacts syt1 in several regions. For the C2B domain, contact occurs in the polybasic face and sites opposite the Ca2+-binding loops. For the C2A domain, contact is seen with the SNARE complex in a region near loop 2. Double electron-electron resonance was used to estimate distances between the two C2 domains of syt1. These distances have broad distributions in solution, which do not significantly change when syt1 is fully associated with the core SNARE complex. The broad distance distributions indicate that syt1 is structurally heterogeneous when bound to the SNAREs and does not assume a well-defined structure. Simulated annealing using electron paramagnetic resonance-derived distance restraints produces a family of syt1 structures where the Ca2+-binding regions of each domain face in roughly opposite directions. The results suggest that when associated with the SNAREs, syt1 is configured to bind opposing bilayers, but that the syt1/SNARE complex samples multiple conformational states. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The type-III secretion effector YopO helps pathogenic Yersinia to outmaneuver the human immune system. Injected into host cells, it functions as a Ser/Thr kinase after activation by actin binding. This activation process is thought to involve large conformational changes. We use PELDOR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering in combination with available crystal structures to study these conformational transitions. Low-resolution hybrid models of the YopO/actin structure in solution were constructed, where the kinase domain of YopO is tilted âbackwardâ compared with the crystal structure, thus shortening the distance between actin and the kinase active site, potentially affecting the substrate specificity of YopO. Furthermore, the GDI domain of the hybrid models resembles a conformation that was previously observed in a crystal structure of the isolated GDI domain. We investigate possible structural reasons for the inactivity of the apo state, analyze its flexibility and discuss the biological implications. YopO/YpkA is a multifunctional type-III effector protein from Yersinia species, the causative agents of the plague. After its injection into host cells, YopO binds to actin. This activates the kinase activity of YopO. Peter et al. use an integrated approach of PELDOR spectroscopy and SAXS to shed light on the large conformational changes involved in this process.},

abstract = {Proteins and their complexes can be heterogeneously disordered. In ensemble modeling of such systems with restraints from several experimental techniques the following problems arise: (a) integration of diverse restraints obtained on different samples under different conditions; (b) estimation of a realistic ensemble width; (c) sufficient sampling of conformational space; (d) representation of the ensemble by an interpretable number of conformers; (e) recognition of weak order with site resolution. Here, I introduce several tools that address these problems, focusing on utilization of distance distribution information for estimating ensemble width. The RigiFlex approach integrates such information with high-resolution structures of ordered domains and small-angle scattering data. The EnsembleFit module provides moderately sized ensembles by fitting conformer populations and discarding conformers with low population. EnsembleFit balances the loss in fit quality upon combining restraint subsets from different techniques. Pair correlation analysis for residues and local compaction analysis help in feature detection. The RigiFlex pipeline is tested on data simulated from the structure 70 kDa protein-RNA complex RsmE/RsmZ. It recovers this structure with ensemble width and difference from ground truth both being on the order of 4.2 {\AA}. EnsembleFit reduces the ensemble of the proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen-associated factor p15PAF from 4,939 to 75 conformers while maintaining good fit quality of restraints. Local compaction analysis for the PaaA2 antitoxin from E. coli O157 revealed correlations between compactness and enhanced residual dipolar couplings in the original NMR restraint set.},

abstract = {We report the use of a novel pulsed ESR technique for distance measurement, based on the detection of double quantum coherence (DQC), which yields high quality dipolar spectra, to significantly extend the range of measurable distances in proteins using nitroxide spin-labels. Eight T4 lysozyme (T4L) mutants, doubly labeled with methanethiosulfonate spin-label (MTSSL), have been studied using DQC-ESR at 9 and 17 GHz. The distances span the range from 20 {\AA} for the 65/76 mutant to 47 {\AA} for the 61/135 mutant. The high quality of the dipolar spectra also allows the determination of the distance distributions, the width of which can be used to set upper and lower bounds in future computational strategy. It is also demonstrated that the shape of these distributions can reveal the presence of multiple conformations of the spin-label, an issue of critical relevance to the structural interpretation of the distances. The distances and distributions found in this study are readily rationalized in terms of the known crystal structure, the characteristic conformers of the nitroxide side chains, and molecular modeling. This study sets the stage for the use of DQC-ESR for determining the tertiary structure of large proteins with just a small number of long-distance constraints.},

Here, we combine spin-labeling double electronâelectron resonance (DEER) and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy to refine the structure of an oligomeric integral membrane protein, Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR), reconstituted in a lipid environment. An essential feature of such a combined approach is that it provides structural distance restraints spanning a range of ca 3â60Â {\AA} while using the same sample preparation (i.e., mutations, paramagnetic labeling, and reconstitution in lipid bilayers) for both ssNMR and DEER. Direct modeling of the multispin effects on DEER signal allowed for the determination of the oligomeric order and for obtaining long-range DEER distance restraints between the ASR trimer subunits that were used to refine the ssNMR structure of ASR. The improved structure of the ASR trimer revealed a more compact packing of helices and side chains at the intermonomer interface, compared to the structure determined using the ssNMR data alone. The extent of the refinement is significant when compared with typical helix movements observed for the active states of homologous proteins. Our combined approach of using complementary DEER and NMR measurements for the determination of oligomeric structures would be widely applicable to membrane proteins where paramagnetic tags can be introduced. Such a method could be used to study the effects of the lipid membrane composition on protein oligomerization and to observe structural changes in protein oligomers upon drug, substrate, and co-factor binding.},

The integrity of this structure is maintained by up to 28 salt bridges and a zipper-like pattern of cation-$\pi$ interactions between helices 4 and 6.

abstract = {The topology of most experimentally determined protein domains is defined by the relative arrangement of secondary structure elements, i.e. $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands, which make up 50-70% of the sequence. Pairing of $\beta$-strands defines the topology of $\beta$-sheets. The packing of side chains between $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets defines the majority of the protein core. Often, limited experimental datasets restrain the position of secondary structure elements while lacking detail with respect to loop or side chain conformation. At the same time the regular structure and reduced flexibility of secondary structure elements make these interactions more predictable when compared to flexible loops and side chains. To determine the topology of the protein in such settings, we introduce a tailored knowledge-based energy function that evaluates arrangement of secondary structure elements only. Based on the amino acid C$\beta$ atom coordinates within secondary structure elements, potentials for amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, secondary structure element packing, $\beta$-strand pairing, loop length, radius of gyration, contact order and secondary structure prediction agreement are defined. Separate penalty functions exclude conformations with clashes between amino acids or secondary structure elements and loops that cannot be closed. Each individual term discriminates for native-like protein structures. The composite potential significantly enriches for native-like models in three different databases of 10,000-12,000 protein models in 80-94% of the cases.

abstract = {In protein structure prediction, it is often the case that a protein segment must be adjusted to connect two fixed segments. This occurs during loop structure prediction in homology modeling as well as in ab initio structure prediction. Several algorithms for this purpose are based on the inverse Jacobian of the distance constraints with respect to dihedral angle degrees of freedom. These algorithms are sometimes unstable and fail to converge. We present an algorithm developed originally for inverse kinematics applications in robotics. In robotics, an end effector in the form of a robot hand must reach for an object in space by altering adjustable joint angles and arm lengths. In loop prediction, dihedral angles must be adjusted to move the C-terminal residue of a segment to superimpose on a fixed anchor residue in the protein structure. The algorithm, referred to as cyclic coordinate descent or CCD, involves adjusting one dihedral angle at a time to minimize the sum of the squared distances between three backbone atoms of the moving C-terminal anchor and the corresponding atoms in the fixed C-terminal anchor. The result is an equation in one variable for the proposed change in each dihedral. The algorithm proceeds iteratively through all of the adjustable dihedral angles from the N-terminal to the C-terminal end of the loop. CCD is suitable as a component of loop prediction methods that generate large numbers of trial structures. It succeeds in closing loops in a large test set 99.79% of the time, and fails occasionally only for short, highly extended loops. It is very fast, closing loops of length 8 in 0.037 sec on average.},

Here we show that K+ inhibits Na+ -dependent binding of substrate to LeuT, promotes an outward-closed/inward-facing conformation of the transporter and increases uptake. To assess K+ -induced conformational dynamics we measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescein site-specifically attached to inserted cysteines and Ni2+ bound to engineered di-histidine motifs (transition metal ion FRET). The measurements supported K+ -induced closure of the transporter to the outside, which was counteracted by Na+ and substrate. Promoting an outward-open conformation of LeuT by mutation abolished the K+ -effect. The K+ -effect depended on an intact Na1 site and mutating the Na2 site potentiated K+ binding by facilitating transition to the inward-facing state.

The NMR and X-ray data exhibited a correlation of 0.49. The GNM results, on the other hand, yielded a correlation of 0.59 with X-ray data and a distinctively better correlation (0.75) with NMR data. The higher correlation between GNM and NMR data, compared to that between GNM and X-ray B factors, is shown to arise from the differences in the spectrum of modes accessible in solution and in the crystal environment.

abstract = {Mechanistic understanding of dynamic membrane proteins such as transporters, receptors, and channels requires accurate depictions of conformational ensembles, and the manner in which they interchange as a function of environmental factors including substrates, lipids, and inhibitors. Spectroscopic techniques such as electron spin resonance (ESR) pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR), also known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER), provide a complement to atomistic structures obtained from x-ray crystallography or cryo-EM, since spectroscopic data reflect an ensemble and can be measured in more native solvents, unperturbed by a crystal lattice. However, attempts to interpret DEER data are frequently stymied by discrepancies with the structural data, which may arise due to differences in conditions, the dynamics of the protein, or the flexibility of the attached paramagnetic spin labels. Recently, molecular simulation techniques such as EBMetaD have been developed that create a conformational ensemble matching an experimental distance distribution while applying the minimal possible bias. Moreover, it has been proposed that the work required during an EBMetaD simulation to match an experimentally determined distribution could be used as a metric with which to assign conformational states to a given measurement. Here, we demonstrate the application of this concept for a sodium-coupled transport protein, BetP. Because the probe, protein, and lipid bilayer are all represented in atomic detail, the different contributions to the work, such as the extent of protein backbone movements, can be separated. This work therefore illustrates how ranking simulations based on EBMetaD can help to bridge the gap between structural and biophysical data and thereby enhance our understanding of membrane protein conformational mechanisms.},

The present work explores an approach to extend beyond the current limitations through assembling protein topologies from idealized $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands.

It optimizes a knowledge-based potential that analyzes radius of gyration, $\beta$-strand pairing, secondary structure element (SSE) packing, amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, contact order, secondary structure prediction agreement and loop closure. Discontinuation of the protein chain favors sampling of non-local contacts and thereby creation of complex protein topologies. The folding simulation is accelerated through exclusion of flexible loop regions further reducing the size of the conformational search space. The algorithm is benchmarked on 66 proteins with lengths between 83 and 293 amino acids. For 61 out of these proteins, the best SSE-only models obtained have an RMSD100 below 8.0 {\AA} and recover more than 20% of the native contacts.

Recent advances in the structural characterization of dopamine and serotonin transporters have opened the way for structure-based modeling and simulations, which, together with experimental data, now provide mechanistic understanding of their transport function and interactions. Here we review recent progress in the elucidation of the structural dynamics of MATs and their conformational landscape and transitions, as well as allosteric regulation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Lipoxygenase enzymes initiate diverse signaling pathways by specifically directing oxygen to different carbons of arachidonate and other polyunsaturated acyl chains, but structural origins of this specificity have remained unclear. We therefore determined the nature of the lipoxygenase interaction with the polar-end of a paramagnetic lipid by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Distances between selected grid points on soybean seed lipoxygenase-1 (SBL1) and a lysolecithin spin-labeled on choline were measured by pulsed (electron) dipolar spectroscopy. The protein grid was designed by structure-based modeling so that five natural side chains were replaced with spin labels. Pairwise distances in 10 doubly spin-labeled mutants were examined by pulsed dipolar spectroscopy, and a fit to the model was optimized. Finally, experimental distances between the lysolecithin spin and each single spin site on SBL1 were also obtained. With these 15 distances, distance geometry localized the polar-end and the spin of the lysolecithin to the region between the two domains in the SBL1 structure, nearest to E236, K260, Q264, and Q544. Mutation of a nearby residue, E256A, relieved the high pH requirement for enzyme activity of SBL1 and allowed lipid binding at pH 7.2. This general approach could be used to locate other flexible molecules in macromolecular complexes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

We present high-resolution structures of Deinococcus radiodurans (Dra)Nramp in multiple conformations to provide a thorough description of the Nramp transport cycle by identifying the key intramolecular rearrangements and changes to the metal coordination sphere. Strikingly, while metal transport requires cycling from outward- to inward-open states, efficient proton transport still occurs in outward-locked (but not inward-locked) DraNramp. We propose a model in which metal and proton enter the transporter via the same external pathway to the binding site, but follow separate routes to the cytoplasm, which could facilitate the co-transport of two cationic species. Our results illustrate the flexibility of the LeuT fold to support a broad range of substrate transport and conformational change mechanisms.},

To interpret the complex EPR spectra that often arise, it is necessary to characterize the rotamers of the spin-labeled side chain and the interactions they make with the local environment in proteins of known structure. For this purpose, crystal structures have been determined for T4 lysozyme bearing a nitroxide side chain (R1) at the solvent-exposed helical sites 41 and 44 in the B helix. These sites are of particular interest in that the corresponding EPR spectra reveal two dynamic states of R1, one of which is relatively immobilized suggesting interactions of the nitroxide with the environment. The crystal structures together with the effect of mutagenesis of nearest neighbors on the motion of R1 suggest intrahelical interactions of 41R1 with the i + 4 residue and of 44R1 with the i + 1 residue. Such interactions appear to be specific to particular rotamers of the R1 side chain.},

abstract = {A major limitation of current comparative modeling methods is the accuracy with which regions that are structurally divergent from homologues of known structure can be modeled. Because structural differences between homologous proteins are responsible for variations in protein function and specificity, the ability to model these differences has important functional consequences. Although existing methods can provide reasonably accurate models of short loop regions, modeling longer structurally divergent regions is an unsolved problem. Here we describe a method based on the de novo structure prediction algorithm, Rosetta, for predicting conformations of structurally divergent regions in comparative models. Initial conformations for short segments are selected from the protein structure database, whereas longer segments are built up by using three- and nine-residue fragments drawn from the database and combined by using the Rosetta algorithm. A gap closure term in the potential in combination with modified Newton's method for gradient descent minimization is used to ensure continuity of the peptide backbone. Conformations of variable regions are refined in the context of a fixed template structure using Monte Carlo minimization together with rapid repacking of side-chains to iteratively optimize backbone torsion angles and side-chain rotamers. For short loops, mean accuracies of 0.69, 1.45, and 3.62 {\AA} are obtained for 4, 8, and 12 residue loops, respectively. In addition, the method can provide reasonable models of conformations of longer protein segments: predicted conformations of 3A root-mean-square deviation or better were obtained for 5 of 10 examples of segments ranging from 13 to 34 residues. In combination with a sequence alignment algorithm, this method generates complete, ungapped models of protein structures, including regions both similar to and divergent from a homologous structure. This combined method was used to make predictions for 28 protein domains in the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 4 (CASP 4) and 59 domains in CASP 5, where the method ranked highly among comparative modeling and fold recognition methods. Model accuracy in these blind predictions is dominated by alignment quality, but in the context of accurate alignments, long protein segments can be accurately modeled. Notably, the method correctly predicted the local structure of a 39-residue insertion into a TIM barrel in CASP 5 target T0186. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily has been shown to include five recognized families, four of which are specific for amino acids and their derivatives. Recent high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data have shown that four additional transporter families (BCCT, TC No. 2.A.15; SSS, 2.A.21; NSS, 2.A.22; and NCS1, 2.A.39), transporting a wide range of solutes, exhibit sufficiently similar folds to suggest a common evolutionary origin. We have used established statistical methods, based on sequence similarity, to show that these families are, in fact, members of the APC superfamily. We also identify two additional families (NCS2, 2.A.40; SulP, 2.A.53) as being members of this superfamily. Repeat sequences, each having five transmembrane $\alpha$-helical segments and arising via ancient intragenic duplications, are demonstrated for all of these families, further strengthening the conclusion of homology. The APC superfamily appears to be the second largest superfamily of secondary carriers, the largest being the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Although the topology of the members of the APC superfamily differs from that of the MFS, both families appear to have arisen from a common ancestral 2 TMS hairpin structure that underwent intragenic triplication followed by loss of a TMS in the APC family, to give the repeat units that are characteristic of these two superfamilies.

SERT is a target for antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs, which block reuptake and prolong neurotransmitter signalling. Here we report X-ray crystallographic structures of human SERT at 3.15 {\AA} resolution bound to the antidepressants (S)-citalopram or paroxetine. Antidepressants lock SERT in an outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding. We further identify the location of an allosteric site in the complex as residing at the periphery of the extracellular vestibule, interposed between extracellular loops 4 and 6 and transmembrane helices 1, 6, 10 and 11. Occupancy of the allosteric site sterically hinders ligand unbinding from the central site, providing an explanation for the action of (S)-citalopram as an allosteric ligand. These structures define the mechanism of antidepressant action in SERT, and provide blueprints for future drug design.},

Besides a disulfide bond association, LAT1 also interacts extensively with 4F2hc on the extracellular side, within the membrane, and on the intracellular side. Biochemical analysis reveals that 4F2hc is essential for the transport activity of the complex. Together, our characterizations shed light on the architecture of the LAT1â4F2hc complex, and provide insights into its function and the mechanisms through which it might be associated with disease.},

abstract = {Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are essential components of mammalian visual and olfactory signal transduction. CNG channels open upon direct binding of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and/or cGMP), but the allosteric mechanism by which this occurs is incompletely understood. Here, we employed double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to measure intersubunit distance distributions in SthK, a bacterial CNG channel from Spirochaeta thermophila. Spin labels were introduced into the SthK C-linker, a domain that is essential for coupling cyclic nucleotide binding to channel opening. DEER revealed an agonist-dependent conformational change in which residues of the Bâ²helix displayed outward movement with respect to the symmetry axis of the channel in the presence of the full agonist cAMP, but not with the partial agonist cGMP. This conformational rearrangement was observed both in detergent-solubilized SthK and in channels reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. In addition to outward movement of the Bâ²-helix, DEER-constrained Rosetta structural models suggest that channel activation involves upward translation of the cytoplasmic domain and formation of state-dependent interactions between the C-linker and the transmembrane domain. Our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized structural transition in a CNG channel and suggest key interactions that may be responsible for allosteric gating in these channels.},

abstract = {Many proteins of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and of the outer envelope of the endosymbiotically derived organelles mitochondria and plastids have a $\beta$-barrel fold. Their insertion is assisted by membrane proteins of the Omp85-TpsB superfamily. These proteins are composed of a C-terminal $\beta$-barrel and a different number of N-terminal POTRA domains, three in the case of cyanobacterial Omp85. Based on structural studies of Omp85 proteins, including the five POTRA-domain-containing BamA protein of Escherichia coli, it is predicted that anaP2 and anaP3 bear a fixed orientation, whereas anaP1 and anaP2 are connected via a flexible hinge. We challenged this proposal by investigating the conformational space of the N-terminal POTRA domains of Omp85 from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 using pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR, or DEER) spectroscopy. The pronounced dipolar oscillations observed for most of the double spin-labeled positions indicate a rather rigid orientation of the POTRA domains in frozen liquid solution. Based on the PELDOR distance data, structure refinement of the POTRA domains was performed taking two different approaches: 1) treating the individual POTRA domains as rigid bodies; and 2) using an all-atom refinement of the structure. Both refinement approaches yielded ensembles of model structures that are more restricted compared to the conformational ensemble obtained by molecular dynamics simulations, with only a slightly different orientation of N-terminal POTRA domains anaP1 and anaP2 compared with the x-ray structure. The results are discussed in the context of the native environment of the POTRA domains in the periplasm.},

abstract = {A disulfide-linked nitroxide side chain (R1) used in site-directed spin labeling of proteins often exhibits an EPR spectrum characteristic of a weakly ordered z-axis anisotropic motion at topographically diverse surface sites, including those on helices, loops and edge strands of $\beta$-sheets. To elucidate the origin of this motion, the first crystal structures of R1 that display simple z-axis anisotropic motion at solvent-exposed helical sites (131 and 151) and a loop site (82) in T4 lysozyme have been determined. Structures of 131R1 and 151R1 determined at cryogenic or ambient temperature reveal an intraresidue C$\alpha$-Hâ¯S$\delta$ interaction that immobilizes the disulfide group, consistent with a model in which the internal motions of R1 are dominated by rotations about the two terminal bonds (Columbus, K{\'{a}}lai, Jeko, Hideg, and Hubbell, Biochemistry 2001;40:3828-3846). Remarkably, the 131R1 side chain populates two rotamers equally, but the EPR spectrum reflects a single dominant dynamic population, showing that the two rotamers have similar internal motion determined by the common disulfide-backbone interaction. The anisotropic motion for loop residue 82R1 is also accounted for by a common disulfide-backbone interaction, showing that the interaction does not require a specific secondary structure. If the above observations prove to be general, then significant variations in order and rate for R1 at noninteracting solvent-exposed helical and loop sites can be assigned to backbone motion because the internal motion is essentially constant.

abstract = {The amino acid-polyamine-organoCation (APC) superfamily is the second largest superfamily of secondary carriers currently known. In this study, we establish homology between previously recognized APC superfamily members and proteins of seven new families. These families include the PAAP (Putative Amino Acid Permease), LIVCS (Branched Chain Amino Acid:Cation Symporter), NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein), CstA (Carbon starvation A protein), KUP (K+ Uptake Permease), BenE (Benzoate:H+ Virginia Symporter), and AE (Anion Exchanger). The topology of the well-characterized human Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1) conforms to a UraA-like topology of 14 TMSs (12 $\alpha$-helical TMSs and 2 mixed coil/helical TMSs). All functionally characterized members of the APC superfamily use cation symport for substrate accumulation except for some members of the AE family which frequently use anion:anion exchange. We show how the different topologies fit into the framework of the common LeuT-like fold, defined earlier (Proteins. 2014 Feb;82(2):336-46), and determine that some of the new members contain previously undocumented topological variations. All new entries contain the two 5 or 7 TMS APC superfamily repeat units, sometimes with extra TMSs at the ends, the variations being greatest within the CstA family. New, functionally characterized members transport amino acids, peptides, and inorganic anions or cations. Except for anions, these are typical substrates of established APC superfamily members. Active site TMSs are rich in glycyl residues in variable but conserved constellations. This work expands the APC superfamily and our understanding of its topological variations.},

They have critical roles in regulating cell volume, controlling ion absorption and secretion across epithelia, and maintaining intracellular chloride homeostasis. These transporters are primary targets for some of the most commonly prescribed drugs. Here we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the NaâKâCl cotransporter NKCC1, an extensively studied member of the CCC family,Â from Danio rerio. The structure defines the architecture of this protein family and reveals how cytosolic and transmembrane domains are strategically positioned for communication.

These results provide insights into ion selectivity, coupling and translocation, and establish a framework for understanding the physiological functions of CCCs and interpreting disease-related mutations.},

Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small $\beta$ sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

abstract = {Pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy, DEER and DQC, require frozen samples. An important issue in the biological application of this technique is how the freezing rate and concentration of cryoprotectant could possibly affect the conformation of biomacromolecule and/or spin-label. We studied in detail the effect of these experimental variables on the distance distributions obtained by DEER from a series of doubly spin-labeled T4 lysozyme mutants. We found that the rate of sample freezing affects mainly the ensemble of spin-label rotamers, but the distance maxima remain essentially unchanged. This suggests that proteins frozen in a regular manner in liquid nitrogen faithfully maintain the distance-dependent structural properties in solution. We compared the results from rapidly freeze-quenched (â¤100 $\mu$s) samples to those from commonly shock-frozen (slow freeze, 1 s or longer) samples. For all the mutants studied we obtained inter-spin distance distributions, which were broader for rapidly frozen samples than for slowly frozen ones. We infer that rapid freezing trapped a larger ensemble of spin label rotamers; whereas, on the time-scale of slower freezing the protein and spin-label achieve a population showing fewer low-energy conformers. We used glycerol as a cryoprotectant in concentrations of 10% and 30% by weight. With 10% glycerol and slow freezing, we observed an increased slope of background signals, which in DEER is related to increased local spin concentration, in this case due to insufficient solvent vitrification, and therefore protein aggregation. This effect was considerably suppressed in slowly frozen samples containing 30% glycerol and rapidly frozen samples containing 10% glycerol. The assignment of bimodal distributions to tether rotamers as opposed to protein conformations is aided by comparing results using MTSL and 4-Bromo MTSL spin-labels. The latter usually produce narrower distance distributions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In an initial step, receptor interaction with G$\alpha$ acts to allosterically trigger GDP release from a binding site located between the nucleotide binding domain and a helical domain, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, site-directed spin labeling and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy are employed to reveal a large-scale separation of the domains that provides a direct pathway for nucleotide escape. Cross-linking studies show that the domain separation is required for receptor enhancement of nucleotide exchange rates. The interdomain opening is coupled to receptor binding via the C-terminal helix of G$\alpha$, the extension of which is a high-affinity receptor binding element.},

To map conformational changes upon binding to the receptor, pairs of spin labels were introduced in arrestin-1 and double electron-electron resonance was used to monitor interspin distance changes upon P-Rh* binding. The results indicate that the relative position of the N and C domains remains largely unchanged, contrary to expectations of a "clam-shell" model. A loop implicated in P-Rh* binding that connects $\beta$-strands V and VI (the "finger loop," residues 67-79) moves toward the expected location of P-Rh* in the complex, but does not assume a fully extended conformation. A striking and unexpected movement of a loop containing residue 139 away from the adjacent finger loop is observed, which appears to facilitate P-Rh*binding. This change is accompanied by smaller movements of distal loops containing residues 157 and 344 at the tips of the N and C domains, which correspond to "plastic" regions of arrestin-1 that have distinct conformations in monomers of the crystal tetramer. Remarkably, the loops containing residues 139, 157, and 344 appear to have high flexibility in both free arrestin-1 and the P-Rh* complex.},

In prokaryotes, SecYEG associates with the motor ATPase SecA to carry out translocation for pre-protein secretion. Previously, we proposed a Brownian ratchet model for transport, whereby the free energy of ATP-turnover favours the directional diffusion of the polypeptide (Allen et al., 2016). Here, we show that ATP enhances this process by modulating secondary structure formation within the translocating protein. A combination of molecular simulation with hydrogendeuterium-exchange mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal an asymmetry across the membrane: ATP-induced conformational changes in the cytosolic cavity promote unfolded pre-protein structure, while the exterior cavity favours its formation. This ability to exploit structure within a pre-protein is an unexplored area of protein transport, which may apply to other protein transporters, such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.},

abstract = {Bacterial outer membrane TonB-dependent transporters function by executing cycles of binding and unbinding to the inner membrane protein TonB. In the vitamin B12 transporter BtuB and the ferric citrate transporter FecA, substrate binding increases the periplasmic exposure of the Ton box, an energy-coupling segment. This increased exposure appears to enhance the affinity of the transporter for TonB. Here, continuous wave and pulse EPR spectroscopy were used to examine the state of the Ton box in the Escherichia coli ferrichrome transporter FhuA. In its apo state, the Ton box of FhuA samples a broad range of positions and multiple conformational substates. When bound to ferrichrome, the Ton box does not extend further into the periplasm, although the structural states sampled by the FhuA Ton box are altered. When bound to a soluble fragment of TonB, the TonB-FhuA complex remains heterogeneous and dynamic, indicating that TonB does not make strong, specific contacts with either the FhuA barrel or the core region of the transporter. This result differs from that seen in the crystal structure of the TonB-FhuA complex. These data indicate that unlike BtuB and FecA, the periplasmic exposure of the Ton box in FhuA does not change significantly in the presence of substrate and that allosteric control of transporter-TonB interactions functions by a different mechanism than that seen in either BtuB or FecA. Moreover, the data indicate that models involving a rotation of TonB relative to the transporter are unlikely to underlie the mechanism that drives TonB-dependent transport.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins. The most widely used spin label is methanthiosulfonate (MTSL). However, the flexibility of this spin label introduces greater uncertainties in EPR measurements obtained for determining structures, side-chain dynamics, and backbone motion of membrane protein systems. Recently, a newer bifunctional spin label (BSL), 3,4-bis(methanethiosulfonylmethyl)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yloxy, has been introduced to overcome the dynamic limitations associated with the MTSL spin label and has been invaluable in determining protein backbone dynamics and inter-residue distances due to its restricted internal motion and fewer size restrictions. While BSL has been successful in providing more accurate information about the structure and dynamics of several proteins, a detailed characterization of the spin label is still lacking. In this study, we characterized BSLs by performing CW-EPR spectral line shape analysis as a function of temperature on spin-labeled sites inside and outside of the membrane for the integral membrane protein KCNE1 in POPC/POPG lipid bilayers and POPC/POPG lipodisq nanoparticles. The experimental data revealed a powder pattern spectral line shape for all of the KCNE1-BSL samples at 296 K, suggesting the motion of BSLs approaches the rigid limit regime for these series of samples. BSLs were further utilized to report for the first time the distance measurement between two BSLs attached on an integral membrane protein KCNE1 in POPC/POPG lipid bilayers at room temperature using dipolar line broadening CW-EPR spectroscopy. The CW dipolar line broadening EPR data revealed a 15 Â± 2 {\AA} distance between doubly attached BSLs on KCNE1 (53/57-63/67) which is consistent with molecular dynamics modeling and the solution NMR structure of KCNE1 which yielded a distance of 17 {\AA}. This study demonstrates the utility of investigating the structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins in physiologically relevant membrane mimetics using BSLs.},

Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to interpret the distance. A 6 ns run comprising the entire RC protein yields a distance distribution that is close to the experimental one. The average distance found by the MD simulation is smaller than the distance obtained by DEER by at least 0.2 nm. To better represent the experiments performed at low temperature (60 K), a MD method to mimic the freezing-in of the room-temperature conformations is introduced. Both MD methods yield similar distances, but the second method has a trend towards a wider distance distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling EPR (SDSL-EPR) was used to determine the structure of the inhibitory region of TnI in the intact cardiac troponin ternary complex. Maeda and collaborators have modeled the inhibitory region of TnI (skeletal 96-112: the structural motif that communicates the Ca2+ signal to actin) as a kinked $\alpha$-helix [Vassylyev, D., Takeda, S., Wakatsuki, S., Maeda, K. & Maeda, Y. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 4847-4852), whereas Trewhella and collaborators have proposed the same region to be a flexible $\beta$-hairpin [Tung, C. S., Wall, M. E., Gallagher, S. C. & Trewhella, J. (2000) Protein Sci. 9, 1312-1326]. To distinguish between the two models, residues 129-145 of cardiac TnI were mutated sequentially to cysteines and labeled with the extrinsic spin probe, MTSSL. Sequence-dependent solvent accessibility was measured as a change in power saturation of the spin probe in the presence of the relaxation agent. In the ternary complex, the 129-137 region followed a pattern characteristic of a regular 3.6 residues/turn $\alpha$-helix. The following region, residues 138-145, showed no regular pattern in solvent accessibility. Measurements of 4 intradomain distances within the inhibitory sequence, using dipolar EPR, were consistent with an $\alpha$-helical structure. The difference in side-chain mobility between the ternary (C{\textperiodcentered}I{\textperiodcentered}T) and binary (C{\textperiodcentered}I) complexes revealed a region of interaction of TnT located at the N-terminal end of the inhibitory sequence, residues 130-135. The above findings for the troponin complex in solution do not support either of the computational models of the binary complex; however, they are in very good agreement with a preliminary report of the x-ray structure of the cardiac ternary complex [Takeda, S. Yamashita, A., Maeda, K. & Maeda, Y. (2002) Biophys. J. 82, 832].},

Despite its fundamental role in chromatin, the tetramer has received little structural investigation. Here, through the use of pulsed electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy coupled with site-directed spin labelling, we survey the structure of the tetramer in solution. We find that tetramer is structurally more heterogeneous on its own than when sequestered in the octamer or nucleosome. In particular, while the central region including the H3-H3â² interface retains a structure similar to that observed in nucleosomes, other regions such as the H3 $\alpha$N helix display increased structural heterogeneity. Flexibility of the H3 $\alpha$N helix in the free tetramer also illustrates the potential for post-translational modifications to alter the structure of this region and mediate interactions with histone chaperones. The approach described here promises to prove a powerful system for investigating the structure of additional assemblies of histones with other important factors in chromatin assembly/fluidity. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2009.

abstract = {Methods for measuring nanometer-scale distances between specific sites in proteins are essential for analysis of their structure and function. In this work we introduce Gd3+ spin labeling for nanometer-range distance measurements in proteins by high-field pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). To evaluate the performance of such measurements, we carried out four-pulse double-electron electron resonance (DEER) measurements on two proteins, p75ICD and $\tau$C14, labeled at strategically selected sites with either two nitroxides or two Gd3+ spin labels. In analogy to conventional site-directed spin labeling using nitroxides, Gd3+ tags that are derivatives of dipicolinic acid were covalently attached to cysteine thiol groups. Measurements were carried out on X-band (â¼9.5 GHz, 0.35 T) and W-band (95 GHz, 3.5 T) spectrometers for the nitroxide-labeled proteins and at W-band for the Gd3+-labeled proteins. In the protein p75ICD, the orientations of the two nitroxides were found to be practically uncorrelated, and therefore the distance distribution could as readily be obtained at W-band as at X-band. The measured Gd3+-Gd3+ distance distribution had a maximum at 2.9 nm, as compared to 2.5 nm for the nitroxides. In the protein $\tau$C14, however, the orientations of the nitroxides were correlated, and the W-band measurements exhibited strong orientation selection that prevented a straightforward extraction of the distance distribution. The X-band measurements gave a nitroxide-nitroxide distance distribution with a maximum at 2.5 nm, and the W-band measurements gave a Gd3+-Gd3+ distance distribution with a maximum at 3.4 nm. The Gd3+-Gd3+ distance distributions obtained are in good agreement with expectations from structural models that take into account the flexibility of the tags and their tethers to the cysteine residues. These results show that Gd3+ labeling is a viable technique for distance measurements at high fields that features an order of magnitude sensitivity improvement, in terms of protein quantity, over X-band pulse EPR measurements using nitroxide spin labels. Its advantage over W-band distance measurements using nitroxides stems from an intrinsic absence of orientation selection. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

For a pair of spin labels, experimental data allows for determination of their distance distribution function, P(r). P(r) is derived as a solution of a first-kind Fredholm integral equation, which is an ill-posed problem. Here, we suggest regularization by the increasing of distance discretization length, to its upper limit where numerical integration still provides agreement with experiment. This upper limit is found to be well above the lower limit for which the solution instability appears because of the ill-posed nature of the problem; so the solution indeed can be regularized in this way. For solving the integral equation, a Monte Carlo trials of P(r) functions is employed. It has an obvious advantage of the fulfillment of the non-negativity constrain for P(r). The approach is checked for model distance distributions and for experimental data taken from literature for doubly spin-labeled DNA and peptide antibiotics. For the case of overlapping broad and narrow distributions, "selective" regularization can be employed in which the effective regularization length may be different for different distance ranges. The method could serve as a useful complement for the traditional approaches basing on Tikhonov regularization.},

Although the state-of-the-art wavelet denoising methods perform better than other denoising methods, they are not very effective for experimental signals. Unlike images and other signals, experimental signals in chemical and biophysical applications, for example, are less tolerant to signal distortion and under-denoising caused by the standard wavelet denoising methods. The new method: 1) provides a method to select the number of decomposition levels to denoise; 2) uses a new formula to calculate noise thresholds that does not require noise estimation; 3) uses separate noise thresholds for positive and negative wavelet coefficients; 4) applies denoising to the approximation component; and 5) allows the flexibility to adjust the noise thresholds. The new method is applied to continuous wave electron spin resonance spectra and it is found that it increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 32 dB without distorting the signal, whereas standard denoising methods improve the SNR by less than 10 dB and with some distortion. In addition, its computation time is more than six times faster.},

The Tikhonov regularization with the regularization parameter determined by the L-curve criterion is then described and tested to confirm its accuracy and reliability. The method is applied to recent experimental results on doubly labeled proteins that have been studied using two pulsed ESR techniques, double quantum coherence (DQC) ESR and double electron-electron resonance (DEER).

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

DEER revealed an agonist-dependent conformational change in which residues of the B'-helix displayed outward movement with respect to the symmetry axis of the channel in the presence of the full agonist cAMP, but not with the partial agonist cGMP. This conformational rearrangement was observed both in detergent-solubilized SthK and in channels reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. In addition to outward movement of the B'-helix, DEER-constrained Rosetta structural models suggest that channel activation involves upward translation of the cytoplasmic domain and formation of state-dependent interactions between the C-linker and the transmembrane domain. Our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized structural transition in a CNG channel and suggest key interactions that may be responsible for allosteric gating in these channels.},

We also leverage these measurements to derive a novel, to our knowledge, structural model for myosin-II in complex with actin and MgADP and compare our model to other recent actomyosin structures.

abstract = {Tikhonov regularization (TIKR) has been demonstrated as a powerful and valuable method for the determination of distance distributions of spin-pairs in bi-labeled biomolecules directly from pulsed ESR signals. TIKR is a direct method, which requires no iteration, and, therefore, provides a rapid and unique solution. However, the distribution obtained tends to exhibit oscillatory excursions with negative portions in the presence of finite noise, especially in the peripheral regions of the distribution. The Shannon-Jaynes entropy of a probability distribution provides an intrinsic non-negativity constraint on the probability distribution and an unbiased way of obtaining information from incomplete data. We describe how the maximum entropy regularization method (MEM) may be applied to solve the ill-posed nature of the dipolar signal in pulsed ESR. We make use of it to suppress the negative excursions of the distance distribution and to increase the tolerance to noise in the dipolar signal. Model studies and experimental data are investigated, and they show that, with the initial or "seed" probability distribution that is required for MEM taken as the TIKR result, then MEM is able to provide a regularized solution, subject to the non-negativity constraint, and it is effective in dealing with noise that is problematic for TIKR. In addition we have incorporated into our MEM method the ability to extract the intermolecular dipolar component, which is embedded in the raw experimental data. We find that MEM minimization, which is implemented iteratively, is greatly accelerated using the TIKR result as the seed, and it converges more successfully. Thus we regard the MEM method as a complement to TIKR by securing a positive pair distance distribution and enhancing the accuracy of TIKR. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MicroRNA and protein sequestration by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has recently generated much interest. In the bacterial Csr/Rsm system, which is considered to be the most general global post-transcriptional regulatory system responsible for bacterial virulence, ncRNAs such as CsrB or RsmZ activate translation initiation by sequestering homodimeric CsrA-type proteins from the ribosome-binding site of a subset of messenger RNAs. However, the mechanism of ncRNA-mediated protein sequestration is not understood at the molecular level. Here we show for Pseudomonas fluorescens that RsmE protein dimers assemble sequentially, specifically and cooperatively onto the ncRNA RsmZ within a narrow affinity range. This assembly yields two different native ribonucleoprotein structures. Using a powerful combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy we elucidate these 70-kilodalton solution structures, thereby revealing the molecular mechanism of the sequestration process and how RsmE binding protects the ncRNA from RNase E degradation.

We used double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to uncover the basis of stimulation of P-glycoprotein adenosine 5â²-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis by multiple substrates and illuminate how substrates and inhibitors differentially affect its transport function. Our results reveal that substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites. By contrast, this state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites. Together with previous data, our findings lead to a general model of substrate and inhibitor coupling to P-glycoprotein.},

abstract = {Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, among them most prominently pulsed electron-electron double resonance experiments (PELDOR/DEER), resolve the conformational dynamics of nucleic acids with high resolution. The wide application of these powerful experiments is limited by the synthetic complexity of some of the best-performing spin labels. The recently developed $\bf\acute{G}$ (G-spin) label, an isoindoline-nitroxide derivative of guanine, can be incorporated non-covalently into DNA and RNA duplexes via Watson-Crick base pairing in an abasic site. We used PELDOR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize $\bf\acute{G}$, obtaining excellent agreement between experiments and time traces calculated from MD simulations of RNA and DNA double helices with explicitly modeled $\bf\acute{G}$ bound in two abasic sites. The MD simulations reveal stable hydrogen bonds between the spin labels and the paired cytosines. The abasic sites do not significantly perturb the helical structure. $\bf\acute{G}$ remains rigidly bound to helical RNA and DNA. The distance distributions between the two bound $\bf\acute{G}$ labels are not substantially broadened by spin-label motions in the abasic site and agree well between experiment and MD. $\bf\acute{G}$ and similar non-covalently attached spin labels promise high-quality distance and orientation information, also of complexes of nucleic acids and proteins.},

We synthesized an iodoacetamide derivative of 2,6-diazaadamantane nitroxide (DZD) spin label that could be doubly incorporated into T4 Lysozyme (T4L) by site-directed spin labeling with efficiency up to 50% per cysteine. The rigidity of the fused ring structure and absence of mobile methyl groups increase the spin echo dephasing time (Tm) at temperatures above 80 K. This enables DEER measurements of distances >4 nm in DZD-labeled T4L in glycerol/water at temperatures up to 150 K with increased sensitivity compared to that of a common spin label such as MTSL. Addition of $\beta$-cyclodextrin reduces the rotational correlation time of the label, slightly increases Tm, and most importantly, narrows (and slightly lengthens) the interspin distance distributions. The distance distributions are in good agreement with simulated distance distributions obtained by rotamer libraries. These results provide a foundation for developing supramolecular recognition to facilitate long-distance DEER measurements at near physiological temperatures.},

abstract = {A new software suite, called Crystallography & NMR System (CNS), has been developed for macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography or solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In contrast to existing structure-determination programs the architecture of CNS is highly flexible, allowing for extension to other structure-determination methods, such as electron microscopy and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. CNS has a hierarchical structure: a high-level hypertext markup language (HTML) user interface, task-oriented user input files, module files, a symbolic structure-determination language (CNS language), and low-level source code. Each layer is accessible to the user. The novice user may just use the HTML interface, while the more advanced user may use any of the other layers. The source code will be distributed, thus source-code modification is possible. The CNS language is sufficiently powerful and flexible that many new algorithms can be easily implemented in the CNS language without changes to the source code. The CNS language allows the user to perform operations on data structures, such as structure factors, electron-density maps, and atomic properties. The power of the CNS language has been demonstrated by the implementation of a comprehensive set of crystallographic procedures for phasing, density modification and refinement.

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining distance distributions between pairs of engineered nitroxide spin-labels in proteins and other biological macromolecules. These measurements require the use of cryogenic temperatures (77 K or less) to prolong the phase memory relaxation time (Tm) sufficiently to enable detection of a DEER echo curve. Generally, a cryoprotectant such as glycerol is added to protein samples to facilitate glass formation and avoid protein clustering (which can result in a large decrease in Tm) during relatively slow flash freezing in liquid N2. However, cryoprotectants are osmolytes and can influence protein folding/unfolding equilibria, as well as species populations in weak multimeric systems. Here we show that submillisecond rapid freezing, achieved by high velocity spraying of the sample onto a rapidly spinning, liquid nitrogen cooled copper disc obviates the requirement for cryoprotectants and permits high quality DEER data to be obtained in absence of glycerol. We demonstrate this approach on five different protein systems: protein A, the metastable drkN SH3 domain, urea-unfolded drkN SH3, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the transmembrane domain of HIV-1 gp41 in lipid bicelles.},

Here we demonstrate the first proof of concept for the use of PELDOR to observe conformational changes in a membrane protein in intact cells. We exploit the fact that outer membrane proteins usually lack reactive cysteines and that paramagnetic spin labels entering the periplasm are selectively reduced to achieve specific labeling of the cobalamin transporter BtuB in Escherichia coli. We characterize conformational changes in the second extracellular loop of BtuB upon ligand binding and compare the PELDOR data with high-resolution crystal structures. Our approach avoids detergent extraction, purification, and reconstitution usually required for these systems. With this approach, structure, function, conformational changes, and molecular interactions of outer membrane proteins can be studied at high resolution in the cellular environment.},

In this chapter, we describe an approach in which SDSL is integrated with computational modeling to map conformations of nucleic acids. This approach builds upon a SDSL tool kit previously developed and validated, which includes three components: (i) a nucleotide-independent nitroxide probe, designated as R5, which can be efficiently attached at defined sites within arbitrary nucleic acid sequences; (ii) inter-R5 distances in the nanometer range, measured via pulsed EPR; and (iii) an efficient program, called NASNOX, that computes inter-R5 distances on given nucleic acid structures. Following a general framework of data mining, our approach uses multiple sets of measured inter-R5 distances to retrieve "correct" all-atom models from a large ensemble of models. The pool of models can be generated independently without relying on the inter-R5 distances, thus allowing a large degree of flexibility in integrating the SDSL-measured distances with a modeling approach best suited for the specific system under investigation. As such, the integrative experimental/computational approach described here represents a hybrid method for determining all-atom models based on experimentally-derived distance measurements.},

For each labeled duplex, four simulations were performed with SP/SP R P/RP SP/RP, and RP/S P labels, with initial all trans label conformations. Another set of four simulations was performed for the 7/19-labeled duplex using a different label starting conformation. The average internitroxide distance ãr MDã was within 0.2 {\AA} for the two sets of simulations for the 7/19-labeled duplex, indicating sufficient sampling of conformational space.

abstract = {Probabilistic inference is an attractive approach to uncertain reasoning and empirical learning in artificial intelligence. Computational difficulties arise, however, because probabilistic models with the necessary realism and flexibility lead to complex distributions over high-dimensional spaces.
 Related problems in other fields have been tackled using Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using Markov chains, providing a rich array of techniques that can be applied to problems in artificial intelligence. The ``Metropolis algorithm'' has been used to solve difficult problems in statistical physics for over forty years, and, in the last few years, the related method of ``Gibbs sampling'' has been applied to problems of statistical inference. Concurrently, an alternative method for solving problems in statistical physics by means of dynamical simulation has been developed as well, and has recently been unified with the Metropolis algorithm to produce the ``hybrid Monte Carlo'' method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling is the basis of the heuristic optimization technique of ``simulated annealing'', and has recently been used in randomized algorithms for approximate counting of large sets.
 In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic inference in artificial intelligence, present the theory of Markov chains, and describe various Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number of supporting techniques. I try to present a comprehensive picture of the range of methods that have been developed, including techniques from the varied literature that have not yet seen wide application in artificial intelligence, but which appear relevant. As illustrative examples, I use the problems of probabilistic inference in expert systems, discovery of latent classes from data, and Bayesian learning for neural networks.},

DEER has been applied to discrete pairs of free radicals in biological macromolecules and to clusters containing small numbers of free radicals in polymers and irradiated materials. The goal of such work is to determine the distance or distribution of distances between radicals, which is an underdetermined problem. That is, the spectrum of dipolar interactions can be readily calculated for any distribution of free radicals, but there are many, quite different distributions of radicals that could produce the same experimental dipolar spectrum. This paper describes two methods that are useful for approximating the distance distributions for the large subset of cases in which the mutual orientations of the free radicals are uncorrelated and the width of the distribution is more than a few percent of its mean. The first method relies on a coordinate transformation and is parameter-free, while the second is based on iterative least-squares with Tikhonov regularization. Both methods are useful in DEER studies of spin-labeled biomolecules containing more than two labels.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

It is known that GCV has good asymptotic properties as n â â but it may not be reliable for small or medium sized n, sometimes giving an estimate that is far too small. We propose a new robust GCV method (RGCV) which chooses $\lambda$ to be the minimizer of $\gamma$V($\lambda$) + (1 - $\gamma$)F($\lambda$), where V($\lambda$) is the GCV function, F($\lambda$) is an approximate average measure of the influence of each data point on f $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ â (0, 1) is a robustness parameter. We show that for any n, RGCV is less likely than GCV to choose a very small value of $\lambda$, resulting in a more robust method. We also show that RGCV has good asymptotic properties as n â â for general linear operator equations with uncorrelated errors. The function EF($\lambda$) approximates the risk ER($\lambda$) for values of $\lambda$ that are asymptotically a bit smaller than the minimizer of ER($\lambda$) (where V($\lambda$) may not approximate well). The 'expected' RGCV estimate is asymptotically optimal as n â â with respect to the 'robust risk' $\gamma$ER($\lambda$) + (1 - $\gamma$)v($\lambda$), where v($\lambda$) is the variance component of the risk, and it has the optimal decay rate with respect to ER($\lambda$) and stronger error criteria. The GCV and RGCV methods are compared in numerical simulations for the problem of estimating the second derivative from noisy data. The results for RGCV with n â¤ 51 are consistent with the asymptotic results, and, for a large range of $\gamma$ values, RGCV is more reliable and accurate than GCV. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The reliability of procedures for extracting the distance distribution between spins from the dipolar evolution function is studied with particular emphasis on broad distributions. A new numerically stable procedure for fitting distance distributions with polynomial interpolation between sampling points is introduced and compared to Tikhonov regularization in the dipolar frequency and distance domains and to approximate Pake transformation. Distance distributions with only narrow peaks are most reliably extracted by distance-domain Tikhonov regularization, while frequency-domain Tikhonov regularization is favorable for distributions with only broad peaks. For the quantification of distributions by their mean distance and variance, Hermite polynomial interpolation provides the best results. Distributions that contain both broad and narrow peaks are most difficult to analyze. In this case a high signal-to-noise ratio is strictly required and approximate Pake transformation should be applied. A procedure is given for renormalizing primary experimental data from protein preparations with slightly different degrees of spin labelling, so that they can be compared directly. Performance of all the data analysis procedures is demonstrated on experimental data for a shape-persistent biradical with a label-to-label distance of 5 nm, for a [2]catenane with a broad distance distribution, and for a doubly spin-labelled double mutant of plant light harvesting complex II.},

abstract = {An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package "DeerAnalysis" (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids. Our goal is to present our advances in order to aid readers in similar applications.},

abstract = {The investigation of the structure and conforma-tional dynamics of biomolecules under physiological conditions is challenging for structural biology. Although pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (like PELDOR) techniques provide long-range distance and orientation information with high accuracy, such studies are usually performed at cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature (RT) PELDOR studies are seemingly impossible due to short electronic relaxation times and loss of dipolar interactions through rotational averaging. We incorporated the rigid nitroxide spin label C Â¸ into a DNA duplex and immobilized the sample on a solid support to overcome this limitation. This enabled orientation-selective PELDOR measurements at RT. A comparison with data recorded at 50 K revealed averaging of internal dynamics, which occur on the ns time range at RT. Thus, our approach adds a new method to study structural and dynamical processes at physiological temperature in the < 10 ms time range with atomistic resolution. Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrosco-py is established as a valued method for investigations of biomolecular structures and conformational flexibility, next to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and optical or infrared spectroscopy. Most common are pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR, also called double electron-electron resonance/ DEER) [1, 2] or double quantum coherence (DQC) [3] experiments. These techniques rely on the detection of the magnetic dipolar interaction between unpaired electrons. For this purpose, two spin labels are covalently attached to specific sides of the system by side-directed spin labeling (SDSL). [4] Such labeling can be performed either during the synthesis of a biopolymer or post-synthetically. [5, 6] PELDOR spectrosco-py in combination with SDSL is not limited by the size of the molecules under investigation and can determine distances in the 1.5-10 nm range for nucleic acids, proteins, and their complexes. [7-9] Due to the intrinsically fast echo dephasing time of nitroxide spin labels at higher temperatures, PELDOR experiments are usually carried out in frozen solutions at % 50 K. [10] Thus, such experiments report on a static frozen conformational ensemble, providing the full conformational accessible space of flexible biomolecules at the freezing temperature. [11] However, freezing may trap biomolecules in specific conformations. Furthermore, cryo-protectants, necessary additives to form a good glass upon freezing, can also affect natural equilibria. [12] Additionally, kinetics for dynamic processes are not accessible in frozen solution. A longstanding goal is to relate PELDOR data acquired at low temperatures to physiological conditions. In order to perform PELDOR measurements at room temperature (RT), one needs to overcome two fundamental limitations which are not present in frozen solutions. First, the rotational motion of the molecules has to be inhibited to avoid averaging out the dipolar interaction. This can be achieved by, for example, immobilization on a solid support. Second, the transverse relaxation time T 2 of the spin label has to be long enough to obtain an appropriate time window for the evolution of the dipolar coupling. A proof of concept for RT DQC experiments has been demonstrated using triarylmethyl (TAM, trityl) labels attached to a biotin-immobilized protein [13] and on double-stranded DNA. [14, 15] As the echo-dephasing mechanism in the liquid phase is strongly driven by the anisotropy of the hyperfine-and g-tensor, the carbon-based trityl radicals with isotropic hyperfine couplings and very small g-tensor aniso-tropy are good candidates for RT experiments. However, incorporation of the bulky and hydrophobic trityl label into biomolecules is limited, for example, to end groups or loops and requires an adequate linker to overcome steric hindrance. [16-19] Spirocyclohexyl-derived nitroxides have also been utilized as spin labels on DNAs [15] and proteins [21] to obtain distance information by PELDOR at RT. Here the absence of the rotating methyl groups on the carbon atoms adjacent to the nitroxide functional groups leads to longer relaxation times. Nevertheless, for both trityls and spirocy-clohexyl nitroxides there are indications that the linkers and the attachment strategy still limit the transverse relaxation time T 2. [16] In the case of nitroxides, the molecules had to be immobilized in solid matrices to prevent the tumbling motion of the biomolecule and the nitroxide spin label. Polysugars, like trehalose and sucrose, exhibit great immobilization and Supporting information and the ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under: https://doi.},

abstract = {Trehalose has been recently promoted as efficient immobilizer of biomolecules for room-temperature EPR studies, including distance measurements between attached nitroxide spin labels. Generally, the structure of nitroxide influences the electron spin relaxation times, being crucial parameters for room-temperature pulse EPR measurements. Therefore, in this work we investigated a series of nitroxides with different substituents adjacent to NO-moiety including spirocyclohexane, spirocyclopentane, tetraethyl and tetramethyl groups. Electron spin relaxation times (T1, Tm) of these radicals immobilized in trehalose were measured at room temperature at X- and Q-bands (9/34 GHz). In addition, a comparison was made with the corresponding relaxation times in nitroxide-labeled DNA immobilized in trehalose. In all cases phase memory times Tm were close to 700 ns and did not essentially depend on structure of substituents. Comparison of temperature dependences of Tm at T = 80-300 K shows that the benefit of spirocyclohexane substituents well-known at medium temperatures (â¼100-180 K) becomes negligible at 300 K. Therefore, unless there are specific interactions between spin labels and biomolecules, the room-temperature value of Tm in trehalose is weakly dependent on the structure of substituents adjacent to NO-moiety of nitroxide. The issues of specific interactions and stability of nitroxide labels in biological media might be more important for room temperature pulsed dipolar EPR than differences in intrinsic spin relaxation of radicals.},

The determination of protein structure and dynamics within the native cellular environment may lead to better understanding of protein behavior. Electron spin resonance (ESR) has emerged as a technique that can report on protein structure and dynamics within cells. Nitroxide based spin labels are capable of reporting on protein dynamics, structure, and backbone flexibility but are limited due to nitroxide reduction occurring in cells. In order to overcome this limitation, we used the oxidizing agent potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ) as well as the cleavage resistant spin label 3-malemido-PROXYL (5-MSL). Furthermore, we hypothesized that injection concentration is an important parameter regarding nitroxide reduction kinetics. By increasing the injection concentration of doubly 5-MSL labeled protein into Xenopus laevis oocytes, we found an increased nitroxide lifetime. Our work demonstrates unprecedented incubation times of 3-h in-cell and 5-h in-cytosol for double electronâelectron resonance (DEER) experiments using nitroxide spin labels. This allows for more meaningful measurements of larger protein systems which may require longer incubation times for equilibration in the cellular milieu. Even longer incubation times are possible by combining our approach with more shielded nitroxides and Q-band.},

abstract = {Recoverin, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) branch of the calmodulin superfamily, is expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells and serves as a calcium sensor in vision. Ca2+-induced conformational changes in recoverin cause extrusion of its covalently attached myristate (termed Ca 2+-myristoyl switch) that promotes translocation of recoverin to disk membranes during phototransduction in retinal rod cells. Here we report double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments on recoverin that probe Ca 2+-induced changes in distance as measured by the dipolar coupling between spin-labels strategically positioned at engineered cysteine residues on the protein surface. The DEER distance between nitroxide spin-labels attached at C39 and N120C is 2.5 Â± 0.1 nm for Ca2+-free recoverin and 3.7 Â± 0.1 nm for Ca2+-bound recoverin. An additional DEER distance (5-6 nm) observed for Ca2+-bound recoverin may represent an intermolecular distance between C39 and N120. 15N NMR relaxation analysis and CW-EPR experiments both confirm that Ca2+-bound recoverin forms a dimer at protein concentrations above 100 $\mu$M, whereas Ca2+-free recoverin is monomeric. We propose that Ca 2+-induced dimerization of recoverin at the disk membrane surface may play a role in regulating Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of dimeric rhodopsin. The DEER approach will be useful for elucidating dimeric structures of NCS proteins in general for which Ca2+-induced dimerization is functionally important but not well understood. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Modern pulse EPR experiments are routinely used to study the structural features of paramagnetic centers. They are usually performed at low temperatures, where relaxation times are long and polarization is high, to achieve a sufficient Signal/Noise Ratio (SNR). However, when working with samples whose amount and/or concentration are limited, sensitivity becomes an issue and therefore measurements may require a significant accumulation time, up to 12 h or more. As the detection scheme of practically all pulse EPR sequences is based on the integration of a spin echo - either primary, stimulated or refocused - a considerable increase in SNR can be obtained by replacing the single echo detection scheme by a train of echoes. All these echoes, generated by Carr-Purcell type sequences, are integrated and summed together to improve the SNR. This scheme is commonly used in NMR and here we demonstrate its applicability to a number of frequently used pulse EPR experiments: Echo-Detected EPR, Davies and Mims ENDOR (Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance), DEER (Electron-Electron Double Resonance|) and EDNMR (Electron-Electron Double Resonance (ELDOR)-Detected NMR), which were combined with a Carr-Purcell- Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) type detection scheme at W-band. By collecting the transient signal and integrating a number of refocused echoes, this detection scheme yielded a 1.6-5 folds SNR improvement, depending on the paramagnetic center and the pulse sequence applied. This improvement is achieved while keeping the experimental time constant and it does not introduce signal distortion. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A recently introduced 5-pulse version of this experiment prolongs the electron spin coherence lifetime and thus provides improved sensitivity or an extended distance range, but suffers from artefacts due to partial excitation and excitation band overlap. In particular, the partial excitation artefact is hard to eliminate experimentally at frequencies where DEER is most sensitive or on spectrometers that provide only monochromatic pulses. Here, a data post-processing method is introduced that removes the partial excitation artefact without relying on previous knowledge of its amplitude and without sensitivity loss. The method is based on acquisition of two traces with shifted positions of the artefact and computation of the artefact shape from the difference of the two traces. Artefact removal was successfully tested both on simulated and experimental data. It was found to be stable for a variety of distance distributions and down to low signal-to-noise ratios in the presence of moderate background decay. The artefact correction method also performs well in the regime of rather strong partial excitation artefacts that is usually encountered with rectangular monochromatic pump pulses on widely available commercial spectrometers.},

abstract = {Triarylmethyl (TAM or trityl) radicals are becoming important for measuring distances in proteins and nucleic acids. Here, we report on a new trityl spin label CT02MA, which conjugates to a protein via a redox stable thioether bond. The performance of the new spin label was demonstrated in W-band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements on doubly trityl-labelled mutants of immunoglobulin G-binding protein 1 (GB1) and ubiquitin. For both doubly CT02MA-labelled proteins we measured, by applying chirped pump pulse(s), relatively narrow distance distributions, comparable to those obtained with the same protein mutants doubly labelled with BrPy-DO3MA-Gd(iii). We noticed, however, that the sample contained some free CT02MA that was difficult to remove at the purification step. Dual labelling of ubiquitin with one CT02MA tag and one BrPy-DO3MA-Gd(iii) tag was achieved as well and the trityl-Gd(iii) distance distribution was measured, facilitated by the use of a dual mode cavity in combination with a chirped pump pulse. We also measured the Gd(iii)-Gd(iii) distance distribution in this sample, showing that the labelling procedure was not fully selective. Nevertheless, these measurements demonstrate the potential of the high sensitivity Gd(iii)-trityl W-band DEER distance measurements in proteins, which can be further exploited by designing orthogonal Gd(iii)/trityl labelling schemes.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the ability of pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy (PDS) to report on the conformation of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) through the sensitive measurement of dipolar interactions between inherent Cu2+ ions. Although the extent and the anisotropy of the Cu ESR spectrum provides challenges for PDS, Ku-band (17.3 GHz) double electron-electron resonance and double-quantum coherence variants of PDS coupled with distance reconstruction methods recover Cu-Cu distances in good agreement with crystal structures. Moreover, Cu-PDS measurements expose distinct differences between the conformational properties of wild-type SOD1 and a single-residue variant (I149T) that leads to the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The I149T protein displays a broader Cu-Cu distance distribution within the SOD1 dimer compared to wild-type. In a nitroxide (NO)-labeled sample, distance distributions obtained from Cu-Cu, Cu-NO, and NO-NO separations reveal increased structural heterogeneity within the protein and a tendency for mutant dimers to associate. In contrast, perturbations caused by the ALS mutation are completely masked in the crystal structure of I149T. Thus, PDS readily detects alterations in metalloenzyme solution properties not easily deciphered by other methods and in doing so supports the notion that increased range of motion and associations of SOD1 ALS variants contribute to disease progression.},

In this sequence, an extra pulse at the pump frequency is used compared with standard four-pulse DEER. The position of the extra pulse is fixed relative to the three pulses of the detection sequence. This significantly reduces the effect of nuclear spin-diffusion on the electron-spin phase relaxation, thereby enabling longer dipolar evolution times that are required to measure longer distances. Using spin-labeled T4 lysozyme at a concentration less than 50 $\mu$M, as an example, we show that the evolution time increases by a factor of 1.8 in protonated solution and 1.4 in deuterated solution to 8 and 12 $\mu$s, respectively, with the potential to increase them further.

We propose a Bayesian method to incorporate a knowledge-based backbone dihedral angle potential into an NMR structure calculation. To avoid bias exerted through the backbone potential, we adjust its weight by inferring it from the experimental data. We demonstrate that an optimally weighted potential leads to an improvement in the accuracy and quality of the final structure, especially with sparse and noisy data. Our findings suggest that no universally optimal weight exists, and that the weight should be determined based on the experimental data.

abstract = {Small-angle X-ray scattering is an increasingly popular technique used to detect protein structures and ensembles in solution. However, the refinement of structures and ensembles against SAXS data is often ambiguous due to the low information content of SAXS data, unknown systematic errors, and unknown scattering contributions from the solvent. We offer a solution to such problems by combining Bayesian inference with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and explicit-solvent SAXS calculations. The Bayesian formulation correctly weights the SAXS data versus prior physical knowledge, it quantifies the precision or ambiguity of fitted structures and ensembles, and it accounts for unknown systematic errors due to poor buffer matching. The method further provides a probabilistic criterion for identifying the number of states required to explain the SAXS data. The method is validated by refining ensembles of a periplasmic binding protein against calculated SAXS curves. Subsequently, we derive the solution ensembles of the eukaryotic chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) against experimental SAXS data. We find that the SAXS data of the apo state of Hsp90 is compatible with a single wide-open conformation, whereas the SAXS data of Hsp90 bound to ATP or to an ATP-analogue strongly suggest heterogenous ensembles of a closed and a wide-open state.},

We addressed these challenges by using a Bayesian approach that produces the posterior probability of a model, given the input data. The posterior probability is defined as a function of the dependence of our FRET metric FRETR on a structure (forward model), a model of noise in the data, as well as prior information about the structure, relative populations of distinct states in the sample, forward model parameters, and data noise. The forward model was validated against kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and in vivo experimental data collected on nine systems of known structure. In addition, our Bayesian approach was validated by a benchmark of 16 protein complexes of known structure. Given the structures of each subunit of the complexes, models were computed from synthetic FRETR data with a distance root-mean-squared deviation error of 14 to 17 AÂ° . The approach is implemented in the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform, allowing us to determine macromolecular structures through a combination of in vivo FRETR data and data from other sources, such as electron microscopy and chemical cross-linking.},

Here we introduce a Bayesian statistical approach that quantifies uncertainty in P(r) arising from noise and numerical regularization. This method provides credible intervals (error bars) of P(r) at each r. This allows practitioners to answer whether or not small features are significant, whether or not apparent shoulders are significant, and whether or not two distance distributions are significantly different from each other.

abstract = {Recently, the target function for crystallographic refinement has been improved through a maximum likelihood analysis, which makes proper allowance for the effects of data quality, model errors, and incompleteness. The maximum likelihood target reduces the significance of false local minima during the refinement process, but it does not completely eliminate them, necessitating the use of stochastic optimization methods such as simulated annealing for poor initial models. It is shown that the combination of maximum likelihood with cross-validation, which reduces overfitting, and simulated annealing by torsion angle molecular dynamics, which simplifies the conformational search problem, results in a major improvement of the radius of convergence of refinement and the accuracy of the refined structure. Torsion angle molecular dynamics and the maximum likelihood target function interact synergistically, the combination of both methods being significantly more powerful than each method individually. This is demonstrated in realistic test cases at two typical minimum Bragg spacings (d(min) = 2.0 and 2.8 {\AA}, respectively), illustrating the broad applicability of the combined method. In an application to the refinement of a new crystal structure, the combined method automatically corrected a mistraced loop in a poor initial model, moving the backbone by 4 {\AA}.},

These weights, however, might not be an optimal descriptor of a given protein structure and predictive model, and a bias is introduced which might result in incorrect structures. In the inferential structure determination framework, both the unknown structure and the disagreement between experimental and back-calculated data are formulated as a joint probability distribution, thus utilizing the full information content of the data. Here, we present the formulation of such a probability distribution where the error in chemical shift prediction is described by either a Gaussian or Cauchy distribution. The methodology is demonstrated and compared to a set of empirically weighted potentials through Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of three small proteins (ENHD, Protein G and the SMN Tudor Domain) using the PROFASI force field and the chemical shift predictor CamShift. Using a clustering-criterion for identifying the best structure, together with the addition of a solvent exposure scoring term, the simulations suggests that sampling both the structure and the uncertainties in chemical shift prediction leads more accurate structures compared to conventional methods using empirical determined weights. The Cauchy distribution, using either sampled uncertainties or predetermined weights, did, however, result in overall better convergence to the native fold, suggesting that both types of distribution might be useful in different aspects of the protein structure prediction.},

Here, by integrating DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy with advanced molecular modeling and docking, the mechanism of the subtype selectivity of human bradykinin receptors for their peptide agonists has been resolved. The conserved middle segments of the bound peptides show distinct conformations that result in different presentations of their N and C termini toward their receptors. Analysis of the peptide-receptor interfaces reveals that the charged N-terminal residues of the peptides are mainly selected through electrostatic interactions, whereas the C-terminal segments are recognized via both conformations and interactions. The detailed molecular picture obtained by this approach opens a new gateway for exploring the complex conformational and chemical space of peptides and peptide analogs for designing GPCR subtype-selective biochemical tools and drugs.},

abstract = {The tremendous pandemic potential of coronaviruses was demonstrated twice in the past few decades by two global outbreaks of deadly pneumonia. Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 {\AA} resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins, implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.},

abstract = {Background: Various forms of the so-called loop closure problem are crucial to protein structure prediction methods. Given an N- and a C-terminal end, the problem consists of finding a suitable segment of a certain length that bridges the ends seamlessly. In homology modelling, the problem arises in predicting loop regions. In de novo protein structure prediction, the problem is encountered when implementing local moves for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Most loop closure algorithms keep the bond angles fixed or semi-fixed, and only vary the dihedral angles. This is appropriate for a full-atom protein backbone, since the bond angles can be considered as fixed, while the ($\phi$, $\psi$) dihedral angles are variable. However, many de novo structure prediction methods use protein models that only consist of C $\alpha$ atoms, or otherwise do not make use of all backbone atoms. These methods require a method that alters both bond and dihedral angles, since the pseudo bond angle between three consecutive C $\alpha$ atoms also varies considerably. Results: Here we present a method that solves the loop closure problem for C $\alpha$ only protein models. We developed a variant of Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), an inverse kinematics method from the field of robotics, which was recently applied to the loop closure problem. Since the method alters both bond and dihedral angles, which is equivalent to applying a full rotation matrix, we call our method Full CCD (FCDD). FCCD replaces CCD's vector-based optimization of a rotation around an axis with a singular value decomposition-based optimization of a general rotation matrix. The method is easy to implement and numerically stable. Conclusion: We tested the method's performance on sets of random protein C$\alpha$ segments between 5 and 30 amino acids long, and a number of loops of length 4, 8 and 12. FCCD is fast, has a high success rate and readily generates conformations close to those of real loops. The presence of constraints on the angles only has a small effect on the performance. A reference implementation of FCCD in Python is available as supplementary information. {\textcopyright} 2005 Boomsma and Hamelryck; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Ligand binding can induce significant conformational changes in proteins. The mechanism of this process couples equilibria associated with the ligand binding event and the conformational change. Here we show that by combining the application of W-band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy with microfluidic rapid freeze quench ($\mu$RFQ) it is possible to resolve these processes and obtain both equilibrium constants and reaction rates. We studied the conformational transition of the nitroxide labeled, isolated carboxy-terminal cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) of the HCN2 ion channel upon binding of the ligand 3â²,5â²-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Using model-based global analysis, the time-resolved data of the $\mu$RFQ DEER experiments directly provide fractional populations of the open and closed conformations as a function of time. We modeled the ligand-induced conformational change in the protein using a four-state model: apo/open (AO), apo/closed (AC), bound/open (BO), bound/closed (BC). These species interconvert according to AC + L r AO + L r BO r BC. By analyzing the concentration dependence of the relative contributions of the closed and open conformations at equilibrium, we estimated the equilibrium constants for the two conformational equilibria and the open-state ligand dissociation constant. Analysis of the time-resolved $\mu$RFQ DEER data gave estimates for the intrinsic rates of ligand binding and unbinding as well as the rates of the conformational change. This demonstrates that DEER can quantitatively resolve both the thermodynamics and the kinetics of ligand binding and the associated conformational change.},

Unfortunately, for hydrophobic lipid-bound or detergent-solubilized membrane proteins, the maximum distance accessible is much lower, because of a strongly reduced coherence time of the electron spins. Here we introduce a pulse sequence, based on a Carr-Purcell decoupling scheme on the observer spin, where each $\pi$-pulse is accompanied by a shaped sech/tanh inversion pulse applied to the second spin, to overcome this limitation. This pump/probe excitation scheme efficiently recouples the dipolar interaction, allowing a substantially longer observation time window to be achieved. This increases the upper limit and accuracy of distances that can be determined in membrane protein complexes. We validated the method on a bis-nitroxide model compound and applied this technique to the trimeric betaine transporter BetP. Interprotomer distances as long as 6 nm could be reliably determined, which is impossible with the existing methods.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporters actively move chemically diverse substrates across biological membranes. Their malfunction leads to human diseases. Many ABC exporters encompass asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs), and some of them are inhibited by the transported substrate. The functional relevance of the catalytic asymmetry or the mechanism for trans-inhibition remains elusive. Here, we investigated TmrAB, a functional homologue of the human antigen translocation complex TAP using advanced electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy. In the presence of ATP, the heterodimeric ABC exporter exists in a tunable equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing conformations. The two NBSs exhibit pronounced asymmetry in the open-to-close equilibrium. The closed conformation is more favored at the degenerate NBS, and closure of either of the NBS is sufficient to open the extracellular gate. We define the mechanistic basis for trans-inhibition, which operates by a reverse transition from the outward-facing state through an occluded conformation. These novel findings uncover the central role of reversible conformational equilibrium in the function and regulation of an ABC exporter and establish a mechanistic framework for future investigations on other medically important transporters with imprinted asymmetry. Also, this study demonstrates for the first-time the feasibility to resolve equilibrium populations at multiple domains and their interdependence for global conformational changes in a large membrane protein complex.},

Analysis of an experimental DEER signal in terms of a distance distribution is a nontrivial task due to the ill-posed nature of the underlying mathematical inversion problem. This work introduces a Bayesian probabilistic inference approach to analyze DEER data, using a multi-Gauss mixture model for the distance distribution. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to determine a posterior probability distribution over model parameter space. This distribution contains all the information available from the data, including a full quantification of the uncertainty about the parameters. The corresponding uncertainty about the distance distribution is captured via an ensemble of posterior predictive distributions. Several synthetic examples illustrate the method. An experimental example shows the importance of model checking and comparison using residual analysis and Bayes factors. Overall, the Bayesian approach allows for more robust inference about protein conformations from DEER spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Sodium-coupled substrate transport plays a central role in many biological processes. However, despite knowledge of the structures of several sodium-coupled transporters, the location of the sodiumbinding site(s) often remains unclear. Several of these structures have the five transmembrane-helix inverted-topology repeat, LeuTlike (FIRL) fold, whose pseudosymmetry has been proposed to facilitate the alternating-access mechanism required for transport. Here, we provide biophysical, biochemical, and computational evidence for the location of the two cation-binding sites in the sodium-coupled betaine symporter BetP. A recent X-ray structure of BetP in a sodium-bound closed state revealed that one of these sites, equivalent to the Na2 site in related transporters, is located between transmembrane helices 1 and 8 of the FIRL-fold; here, we confirm the location of this site by other means. Based on the pseudosymmetry of this fold, we hypothesized that the second site is located between the equivalent helices 6 and 3. Molecular dynamics simulations of the closed-state structure suggest this second sodium site involves two threonine sidechains and a backbone carbonyl from helix 3, a phenylalanine from helix 6, and a water molecule. Mutating the residues proposed to form the two binding sites increased the apparent Km and Kd for sodium, as measured by betaine uptake, tryptophan fluorescence, and 22Na+ binding, and also diminished the transient currents measured in proteoliposomes using solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for the identity of the residues forming the sodium-binding sites in BetP.},

By comparing the distribution of conformers in the presence and absence of nucleotide, we show that conformational selection is the dominant mechanism by which Ras and Rho undergo nucleotide-dependent conformational changes.

However, conformational changes occurring in the receptor prior and upon association with other molecules are diverse and not obvious to predict when only a few structures of the receptor are available.

For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Macromolecular structures calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance data are not fully determined by experimental data but depend on subjective choices in data treatment and parameter settings. This makes it difficult to objectively judge the precision of the structures. We used Bayesian inference to derive a probability distribution that represents the unknown structure and its precision. This probability distribution also determines additional unknowns, such as theory parameters, that previously had to be chosen empirically. We implemented this approach by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our method provides an objective figure of merit and improves structural quality.},

abstract = {The structural and dynamical characterization of biomolecules holds central importance in the endeavor to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating living systems. However, owing to the inherent heterogeneity of biomolecular interactions within cells, it is often difficult to understand the overall structure and dynamics of biomolecules using any experimental method in isolation. In this regard, hybrid methods that combine data from multiple experiments to generate a comprehensive model of biomolecular complexes have gained prominence in the last few years. In this article, we discuss the advancements in hybrid methods, with a particular focus on the role of computation in their development and application. We further outline the future directions that hybrid methods are likely to take, regarding the advancements in techniques such as X-ray free-electron laser single- particle imaging, and electron cryo-tomography. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting the future goals of broader consensus and collaboration within the integrative/hybrid structural biology community and for disseminating the data generated by hybrid modeling efforts.},

Although uptake of precursor and exit of product can proceed as two independent steps, there is increasing evidence that these processes are often linked and that transport is facilitated by a single antiport mechanism. Features of antiport mechanisms and advantages for the organism of catalysing precursor/product antiport will be illustrated by discussing a number of wellâcharacterized systems. Based on precursorâproduct conversion stoichiometries, structural relatedness between precursors and products, and energetic and kinetic considerations, new examples of antiport systems will be proposed.

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining distance distributions between pairs of engineered nitroxide spin-labels in proteins and other biological macromolecules. These measurements require the use of cryogenic temperatures (77 K or less) to prolong the phase memory relaxation time (Tm) sufficiently to enable detection of a DEER echo curve. Generally, a cryoprotectant such as glycerol is added to protein samples to facilitate glass formation and avoid protein clustering (which can result in a large decrease in Tm) during relatively slow flash freezing in liquid N2. However, cryoprotectants are osmolytes and can influence protein folding/unfolding equilibria, as well as species populations in weak multimeric systems. Here we show that submillisecond rapid freezing, achieved by high velocity spraying of the sample onto a rapidly spinning, liquid nitrogen cooled copper disc obviates the requirement for cryoprotectants and permits high quality DEER data to be obtained in absence of glycerol. We demonstrate this approach on five different protein systems: protein A, the metastable drkN SH3 domain, urea-unfolded drkN SH3, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and the transmembrane domain of HIV-1 gp41 in lipid bicelles.},

The algorithm is specifically designed for use in multiway decomposition methods such as PARAFAC and N-mode principal component analysis. In those methods the typical situation is that there is a high ratio between the numbers of objects and variables in the regression problems solved. Furthermore, very similar regression problems are solved many times during the iterative procedures used. The algorithm proposed is based on the de facto standard algorithm NNLS by Lawson and Hanson, but modified to take advantage of the special characteristics of iterative algorithms involving repeated use of non-negativity constraints. The principle behind the NNLS algorithm is described in detail and a comparison is made between this standard algorithm and the new algorithm called FNNLS (fast NNLS). {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In cancer cells and diabetes, dysregulation of AATs leads to metabolic reprogramming, which changes intracellular amino acid levels, contributing to the pathogenesis of cancer, obesity and diabetes. Indeed, the neutral amino acid transporters (NATs) SLC7A5/LAT1 and SLC1A5/ASCT2 are likely involved in several human malignancies.

Here we present the structure of a CCC, the Mus musculus K+-Cl-cotransporter (KCC) KCC4, in lipid nanodiscs determined by cryo-EM. The structure, captured in an inside-open conformation, reveals the architecture of KCCs including an extracellular domain poised to regulate transport activity through an outer gate. We identify binding sites for substrate K+ and Cl- ions, demonstrate the importance of key coordinating residues for transporter activity, and provide a structural explanation for varied substrate specificity and ion transport ratio among CCCs.

The CLC exchangers, unlike canonical âping-pong' antiporters, simultaneously bind and translocate substrates through partially congruent pathways. How ions of opposite charge bypass each other while moving through a shared pathway remains unknown. Here, we use MD simulations, biochemical and electrophysiological measurements to identify two conserved phenylalanine residues that form an aromatic pathway whose dynamic rearrangements enable H+ movement outside the Cl- pore. These residues are important for H+ transport and voltage-dependent gating in the CLC exchangers. The aromatic pathway residues are evolutionarily conserved in CLC channels where their electrostatic properties and conformational flexibility determine gating. We propose that Cl- and H+ move through physically distinct and evolutionarily conserved routes through the CLC channels and transporters and suggest a unifying mechanism that describes the gating mechanism of both CLC subtypes.},

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of KCCs is structure-solved for the first time, revealing two conserved phosphorylation harboring segments (PHSs), which exhibit different conformation between P-mimic and DP-mimic mutants, explaining the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation. DIOA is located in between the two transmembrane domains, tightly bound to the loop between TM10 and TM11, locking the transporter in inward-facing conformation.

We find that variations in the common core and emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to GT-A diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during evolution. Using evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 90% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs.

The predicted conformational change, which is a linear combination of multiple low-frequency normal modes that are solved from the elastic network model, is computed as a response displacement induced by a perturbation to the system Hamiltonian that incorporates the given distance constraints. For a list of test cases, we find that the computed response displacement overlaps significantly with the measured conformational changes, when only a handful of pairwise constraints are used (â¤10). The performance of this method is also shown to be robust against different choices of pairwise distance constraints and errors in their values. This method, if supplied with the experimentally derived distance constraints (for example, from NMR or other spectroscopic measurements), can be applied to the analysis of protein conformational changes toward transient states. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Computational protein structure prediction is a long-standing challenge in bioinformatics. In the process of predicting protein 3D structures, it is common that parts of an experimental structure are missing or parts of a predicted structure need to be remodeled. The process of predicting local protein structures of particular regions is called loop modeling. In this paper, five new loop modeling methods based on machine learning techniques, called NearLooper, ConLooper, ResLooper, HyLooper1, and HyLooper2 are proposed. NearLooper is based on the nearest neighbor technique. ConLooper applies deep convolutional neural networks to predict C $\alpha$ atoms distance matrix as an orientation-independent representation of protein structure. ResLooper uses residual neural networks instead of deep convolutional neural networks. HyLooper1 combines the results of NearLooper and ConLooper while HyLooper2 combines NearLooper and ResLooper. Three commonly used benchmarks for loop modeling are used to compare the performance between these methods and existing state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results show promising performance in which our best method improves existing state-of-the-art methods by 28 and 54 percent of average RMSD on two datasets while being comparable on the other one.},

It catalyzes antiport of His and some neutral amino acids such as Ile, Leu, Val, Cys, Met, Gln and Phe thus being involved in amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, LAT1 is over-expressed in many human cancers that are characterized by increased demand of amino acids. Therefore LAT1 was recently acknowledged as a novel target for cancer therapy. However, knowledge on molecular mechanism of LAT1 transport is still scarce. Methods Combined approaches of bioinformatics, site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification, and transport assay in proteoliposomes, have been adopted to unravel dark sides of human LAT1 structure/function relationships. Results It has been demonstrated that residues F252, S342, C335 are crucial for substrate recognition and C407 plays a minor role. C335 and C407 cannot be targeted by SH reagents. The transporter has a preferential dimeric structure and catalyzes an antiport reaction which follows a simultaneous random mechanism. Conclusions Critical residues of the substrate binding site of LAT1 have been probed. This site is not freely accessible by molecules other than substrate. Similarly to LeuT, K+ has some regulatory properties on LAT1. General significance The collected data represent a solid basis for deciphering molecular mechanism underlying LAT1 function.},

abstract = {Metallochaperones are responsible for shuttling metal ions to target proteins. Thus, a metallochaperone's structure must be sufficiently flexible both to hold onto its ion while traversing the cytoplasm and to transfer the ion to or from a partner protein. Here, we sought to shed light on the structure of Atox1, a metallochaperone involved in the human copper regulation system. Atox1 shuttles copper ions from the main copper transporter, Ctr1, to the ATP7b transporter in the Golgi apparatus. Conventional biophysical tools such as X-ray or NMR cannot always target the various conformational states of metallochaperones, owing to a requirement for crystallography or low sensitivity and resolution. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has recently emerged as a powerful tool for resolving biological reactions and mechanisms in solution. When coupled with computational methods, EPR with site-directed spin labeling and nanoscale distance measurements can provide structural information on a protein or protein complex in solution. We use these methods to show that Atox1 can accommodate at least four different conformations in the apo state (unbound to copper), and two different conformations in the holo state (bound to copper). We also demonstrate that the structure of Atox1 in the holo form is more compact than in the apo form. Our data provide insight regarding the structural mechanisms through which Atox1 can fulfill its dual role of copper binding and transfer.},

abstract = {A significant problem with paramagnetic tags attached to proteins and nucleic acids is their conformational mobility. Each tag is statistically distributed within a volume between 5 and 10 Angstroms across; structural biology conclusions from NMR and EPR work are necessarily diluted by this uncertainty. The problem is solved in electron spin resonance, but remains open in the other major branch of paramagnetic resonance-pseudocontact shift (PCS) NMR spectroscopy, where structural biologists have so far been reluctantly using the point paramagnetic centre approximation. Here we describe a new method for extracting probability densities of lanthanide tags from PCS data. The method relies on Tikhonov-regularised 3D reconstruction and opens a new window into biomolecular structure and dynamics because it explores a very different range of conditions from those accessible to double electron resonance work on paramagnetic tags: a room-temperature solution rather than a glass at cryogenic temperatures. The method is illustrated using four different Tm3+ DOTA-M8 tagged mutants of human carbonic anhydrase II; the results are in good agreement with rotamer library and DEER data. The wealth of high-quality pseudocontact shift data accumulated by the biological magnetic resonance community over the last 30 years, and so far only processed using point models, could now become a major source of useful information on conformational distributions of paramagnetic tags in biomolecules.},

Here, we report EPR double electron-electron resonance (DEER) studies on the most ubiquitous GCAP isoform, GCAP1 and site-directed mutagenesis analysis to determine an atomic resolution structural model of a GCAP1 dimer. Nitroxide spin-label probes were introduced at individual GCAP1 residues: T29C, E57C, E133C, and E154C. The intermolecular distance of each spin-label probe (measured by DEER) defined restraints for calculating the GCAP1 dimeric structure by molecular docking. The DEER-derived structural model of the GCAP1 dimer was similar within the experimental error for both the Mg2+-bound activator and Ca2+-bound inhibitor states (RMSD < 2.0 {\AA}). The GCAP1 dimer possesses intermolecular hydrophobic contacts involving the side chain atoms of H19, Y22, F73 and V77. The structural model of the dimer was validated by GCAP1 mutations (H19R, Y22D, F73E, and V77E) at the dimer interface that each abolished protein dimerization. Previous studies have shown that each of these mutants either diminished or completely suppressed the ability of GCAP1 to activate the cyclase. These results suggest that GCAP1 dimerization may affect compartmentalization of GCAP1 in the photoreceptors and/or affect regulation of the cyclase activity.},

This C-H bond oxy-functionalization activity has huge potential in biotechnological applications. Class I CYPs receive the two electrons required for oxygen activation from NAD(P)H via a ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. The interaction of Class I CYPs with their cognate ferredoxin is specific. In order to reconstitute the activity of diverse CYPs, structural characterization of CYP-ferredoxin complexes is necessary, but little structural information is available. Here we report a structural model of such a complex (CYP199A2-HaPux) in frozen solution derived from distance and orientation restraints gathered by the EPR technique of orientation-selective double electron-electron resonance (os-DEER). The long-lived oscillations in the os-DEER spectra were well modeled by a single orientation of the CYP199A2-HaPux complex. The structure is different from the two known Class I CYP-Fdx structures: CYP11A1-Adx and CYP101A1-Pdx. At the protein interface, HaPux residues in the [Fe2S2] cluster-binding loop and the $\alpha$3 helix and the C-terminus residue interact with CYP199A2 residues in the proximal loop and the C helix. These residue contacts are consistent with biochemical data on CYP199A2-ferredoxin binding and electron transfer. Electron-tunneling calculations indicate an efficient electron-transfer pathway from the [Fe2S2] cluster to the heme. This new structural model of a CYP-Fdx complex provides the basis for tailoring CYP enzymes for which the cognate ferredoxin is not known, to accept electrons from HaPux and display monooxygenase activity.},

abstract = {HIV type I (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzes the conversion of viral RNA into DNA, initiating the chain of events leading to integration of proviral DNA into the host genome. RT is expressed as a single polypeptide chain within the Gag-Pol polyprotein, and either prior to or following excision by HIV-1 protease forms a 66 kDa chain (p66) homodimer precursor. Further proteolytic attack by HIV-1 protease cleaves the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of a single subunit to yield the mature p66/p51 heterodimer. Here, we probe the spatial domain organization within the p66 homodimer using pulsed Q-band double electron-electron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy to measure a large number of intra- and intersubunit distances between spin labels attached to surface-engineered cysteines. The DEER-derived distances are fully consistent with the structural subunit asymmetry found in the mature p66/p51 heterodimer in which catalytic activity resides in the p66 subunit, while the p51 subunit purely serves as a structural scaffold. Furthermore, the p66 homodimer precursor undergoes a conformational change involving the thumb, palm, and finger domains in one of the subunits (corresponding to the p66 subunit in the mature p66/p51 heterodimer) from a closed to a partially open state upon addition of a nonnucleoside inhibitor. The relative orientation of the domains was modeled by simulated annealing driven by the DEER-derived distances. Finally, the RNase H domain that is cleaved to generate p51 in the mature p66/p51 heterodimer is present in 2 major conformers. One conformer is fully solvent accessible thereby accounting for the observation that only a single subunit of the p66 homodimer precursor is susceptible to HIV-1 protease.},

Phytochromes, found in bacteria, fungi, and plants, can discriminate the ratio of red and far-red light using the isomerization of a bilin chromophore bound to a photosensory module to trigger downstream conformational changes in the protein. Here, we investigated by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy the light-driven domain mechanics of a minimal monomeric photosensory module from the group II phytochrome Cph2 from Synechocystis sp.

We could unambiguously trace the light-driven secondary structural rearrangement of its tongue region, and we found a translational motion of the PHY domain that is related to what was found before by X-ray studies in a group I module. Our analysis demonstrates a common light response in the photosensory modules of phytochromes, orchestrated solely by the GAF-PHY bidomain independent of further quaternary interactions or the nature of downstream effector domains. Assafa et al. describe the conformational changes of a minimal photosensory module of a phytochrome, a protein sensing red and far-red light in plants, bacteria, and fungi.

abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential element of nearly all Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes and serves to protect the cell from adverse environmental stresses. Seven members of the lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) protein family function together to transport LPS from the inner membrane (IM) to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Each of these proteins has a solved crystal structure, including LptC, which is a largely periplasmic protein that is associated with the IM LptB 2 FG complex and anchored to the membrane by an N-terminal helix. LptC directly binds LPS and is hypothesized to be involved in the transfer of LPS to another periplasmic protein, LptA. Purified and in solution, LptC forms a dimer. Here, point mutations designed to disrupt formation of the dimer are characterized using site-directed spin labeling double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, light scattering, circular dichroism, and computational modeling. The computational studies reveal the molecular interactions that drive dimerization of LptC and elucidate how the disruptive mutations change this interaction, while the DEER and light scattering studies identify which mutants disrupt the dimer. And, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and comparing the results to the previous quantitative characterization of the interactions between dimeric LptC and LPS and LptA, the functional consequences of monomeric LptC were also determined. These results indicate that disruption of the dimer does not affect LPS or LptA binding and that monomeric LptC binds LPS and LptA at levels similar to dimeric LptC.},

abstract = {An intensively investigated intermediate state of protein folding is the molten globule (MG) state, which contains secondary but hardly any tertiary structure. In previous work, we have determined the distances between interacting spins within maltose binding protein (MBP) in its native state using continuous wave and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Seven double mutants had been employed to investigate the structure within the two domains of MBP. DEER data nicely corroborated the previously available X-ray data. Even in its MG state, MBP is known to still bind its ligand maltose. We therefore hypothesized that there must be a defined structure around the binding pocket of MBP already in the absence of tertiary structure. Here we have investigated the functional and structural difference between native and MG state in the open and closed form with a new set of MBP mutants. In these, the spin-label positions were placed near the active site. Binding of its ligands leads to a conformational change from open to closed state, where the two domains are more closely together. The complete set of MBP mutants was analyzed at pH 3.2 (MG) and pH 7.4 (native state) using double-quantum coherence EPR. The values were compared with theoretical predictions of distances between the labels in biradicals constructed by molecular modeling from the crystal structures of MBP in open and closed form and were found to be in excellent agreement. Measurements show a defined structure around the binding pocket of MBP in MG, which explains maltose binding. A new and important finding is that in both states ligand-free MBP can be found in open and closed form, while ligand-bound MBP appears only in closed form because of maltose binding.},

abstract = {More than two decades ago, the activation mechanism for the membrane-bound photoreceptor and prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin was uncovered. Upon light-induced changes in ligandâreceptor interaction, movement of specific transmembrane helices within the receptor opens a crevice at the cytoplasmic surface, allowing for coupling of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). The general features of this activation mechanism are conserved across the GPCR superfamily. Nevertheless, GPCRs have selectivity for distinct G-protein family members, but the mechanism of selectivity remains elusive. Structures of GPCRs in complex with the stimulatory G protein, Gs, and an accessory nanobody to stabilize the complex have been reported, providing information on the intermolecular interactions. However, to reveal the structural selectivity filters, it will be necessary to determine GPCRâG protein structures involving other G-protein subtypes. In addition, it is important to obtain structures in the absence of a nanobody that may influence the structure. Here, we present a model for a rhodopsinâG protein complex derived from intermolecular distance constraints between the activated receptor and the inhibitory G protein, Gi, using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and spin-labeling methodologies. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the overall stability of the modeled complex. In the rhodopsinâGi complex, Gi engages rhodopsin in a manner distinct from previous GPCRâGs structures, providing insight into specificity determinants.},

abstract = {We discuss excluded volume effects on the background signal of double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments. Assuming spherically symmetric pervaded volumes, an analytical expression of the background signal is derived based on the shell-factorization approach. The effects of crowding and off-center label positions are discussed. Crowding is taken into account using the Percus-Yevick approximation for the radial distribution function of the particle centers. In addition, a versatile approach relating the pair-correlation function of the particle centers with those of off-center labels is introduced. Limiting expressions applying to short and long dipolar evolution times are derived. Furthermore, we show under which conditions the background with significant excluded volume effects resembles that originating from a fractal dimensionality ranging from 3 to 6. DEER time domain data of spin-probed samples of human serum albumin (HSA) are shown to be strongly affected by excluded-volume effects. The excluded volume is determined from the simultaneous analysis of spectra recorded at various protein concentrations but a constant probe-to-protein ratio. The spin-probes 5-DOXYL-stearic acid (5-DSA) and 16-DOXYL-stearic acid (16-DSA) are used, which, when taken up by HSA, give rise to broad and well-defined distance distributions, respectively. We compare different, model-free approaches of analyzing these data. The most promising results are obtained by the concurrent Tikhonov regularization of all spectra when a common background model is simultaneously adjusted such that the a posteriori probability is maximized. For the samples of 16-DSA in HSA, this is the only approach that allows suppressing a background artifact. We suggest that the delineated simultaneous analysis procedure can be generally applied to reduce ambiguities related to the ill-posed extraction of distance distributions from DEER spectra. This approach is particularly valuable for dipolar signals resulting from broad distance distributions, which as a consequence, are devoid of explicit dipolar oscillations. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {More than 80 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the SLC6A8 creatine transporter (hCRT1) are responsible for cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome (CCDS), which gives rise to a spectrum of neurological defects, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder. To gain insight into the nature of the molecular defects caused by these mutations, we quantitatively profiled the cellular processing, trafficking, expression, and function of eight pathogenic CCDS variants in relation to the wild type (WT) and one neutral isoform. All eight CCDS variants exhibit measurable proteostatic deficiencies that likely contribute to the observed LOF. However, the magnitudes of their specific effects on the expression and trafficking of hCRT1 vary considerably, and we find that the LOF associated with two of these variants primarily arises from the disruption of the substrate-binding pocket. In conjunction with an analysis of structural models of the transporter, we use these data to suggest mechanistic classifications for these variants. To evaluate potential avenues for therapeutic intervention, we assessed the sensitivity of these variants to temperature and measured their response to the proteostasis regulator 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). Only one of the tested variants (G132V) is sensitive to temperature, though its response to 4-PBA is negligible. Nevertheless, 4-PBA significantly enhances the activity of WT hCRT1 in HEK293T cells, which suggests it may be worth evaluating as a therapeutic for female intellectual disability patients carrying a single CCDS mutation. Together, these findings reveal that pathogenic SLC6A8 mutations cause a spectrum of molecular defects that should be taken into consideration in future efforts to develop CCDS therapeutics.},

Our HDX-MS data pinpoint LeuT segments involved in substrate transport and reveal for the first time a comprehensive and detailed view of the dynamics associated with transition of the transporter between outward- and inward-facing configurations in a Na+- and K+-dependent manner. The results suggest that partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1/5/6/7 drives LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation toward an inward-facing open state. These hitherto unknown, large-scale conformational changes in functionally important transmembrane segments, observed for LeuT in detergentsolubilized form and when embedded in a native-like phospholipid bilayer, could be of physiological relevance for the translocation process.},

We measured currents induced by rapid application of serotonin employing varying intracellular (co-)substrate concentrations and interpreted the data using kinetic modeling. Our measurements revealed that the induction of the substrate-exchange mode depends on both voltage and intracellular Na+ concentrations because intracellular Na+ release occurs before serotonin release and is highly electrogenic. This voltage dependence was blunted by electrogenic binding of intracellular K+ and, notably, also H+. In addition, our data suggest that Cl- is bound to SERT during the entire catalytic cycle. Our experiments, therefore, document an essential role of electrogenic binding of K+ or of H+ to the inward-facing conformation of SERT in (i) cancelling out the electrogenic nature of intracellular Na+ release and (ii) in selecting the forward-transport over the substrate-exchange mode. Finally, the kinetics of intracellular Na+ release and K+ (or H+) binding result in a voltage-independent rate-limiting step where SERT may return to the outward-facing state in a KCl- or HCl-bound form.},

Here, we apply hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the conformational dynamics of human SERT in the absence and presence of known substrates and targeted drugs. Our results reveal significant changes in dynamics in regions TM1, EL3, EL4, and TM12 upon binding co-transported ions (Na + /K + ) and ligand-mediated changes in TM1, EL3 and EL4 upon binding 5-HT, the drugs S-citalopram, cocaine and ibogaine. Our results provide a comprehensive direct view of the conformational response of SERT uponÂ binding both biologically relevant substrate/ions and ligands of pharmaceutical interest, thus advancing our understanding of the structure-function relationship in SERT.},

abstract = {The coupled transport of ions and substrates allows transporters to accumulate substrates using the energy of transmembrane ion gradients and electrical potentials. During transport, conformational changes that switch accessibility of substrate and ion binding sites from one side of the membrane to the other must be controlled so as to prevent uncoupled movement of ions or substrates. In the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family, Na+ stabilizes the transporter in an outward-open state, thus decreasing the likelihood of uncoupled Na+ transport. Substrate binding, in a step essential for coupled transport, must overcome the effect of Na+, allowing intracellular substrate and Na+ release from an inward-open state. However, the specific elements of the protein that mediate this conformational response to substrate binding are unknown. Previously, we showed that in the prokaryotic NSS transporter LeuT, the effect of Na+ on conformation requires the Na2 site, where it influences conformation by fostering interaction between two domains of the protein. Here, we used cysteine accessibility to measure conformational changes of LeuT in Escherichia coli membranes. We identified a conserved tyrosine residue in the substrate binding site required for substrate to convert LeuT to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter domains. We further identify additional required interactions between the two transporter domains in the extracellular pathway. Together with our previous work on the conformational effect of Na+, these results identify mechanistic components underlying ion-substrate coupling in NSS transporters.},

Recent structures of Deinococcus radiodurans Nramp (DraNramp) in multiple conformations revealed the intramolecular rearrangements required for alternating access of the metalbinding site to the external or cytosolic environment. Here, using recombinant proteins and metal transport and cysteine accessibility assays, we demonstrate that two parallel cytoplasm- accessible networks of conserved hydrophilic residues in DraNramp, one lining the wide intracellular vestibule for metal release and the other forming a narrow proton transport pathway, are essential for metal transport. We further show that mutagenic or posttranslational modifications of transmembrane helix (TM) 6b, which structurally links these two pathways, impede normal conformational cycling and metal transport. TM6bcontains two highly conserved histidines, His232 and His237. We found that different mutagenic perturbations of His232, just below the metal-binding site along the proton exit route, differentially affect DraNramp's conformational state, suggesting that His232 serves as a pivot point for conformational changes. In contrast, any replacement of His237, lining the metal exit route, locked the transporter in a transport-inactive outward- closed state. We conclude that these two histidines, and TM6b more broadly, help trigger the bulk rearrangement of DraNramp to the inward-open state upon metal binding and facilitate return of the empty transporter to an outward-open state upon metal release.},

abstract = {Biological ion channels are nanoscale transmembrane pores. When water and ions are enclosed within the narrow confines of a sub-nanometer hydrophobic pore, they exhibit behavior not evident from macroscopic descriptions. At this nanoscopic level, the unfavorable interaction between the lining of a hydrophobic pore and water may lead to stochastic liquid-vapor transitions. These transient vapor states are "dewetted", i.e. effectively devoid of water molecules within all or part of the pore, thus leading to an energetic barrier to ion conduction. This process, termed "hydrophobic gating", was first observed in molecular dynamics simulations of model nanopores, where the principles underlying hydrophobic gating (i.e., changes in diameter, polarity, or transmembrane voltage) have now been extensively validated. Computational, structural, and functional studies now indicate that biological ion channels may also exploit hydrophobic gating to regulate ion flow within their pores. Here we review the evidence for this process and propose that this unusual behavior of water represents an increasingly important element in understanding the relationship between ion channel structure and function.},

abstract = {Membrane transporters rely on highly coordinated structural transitions between major conformational states for their function, to prevent simultaneous access of the substrate binding site to both sides of the membrane-amode of operation known as the alternating access model. Although this mechanismsuccessfully accounts for the efficient exchange of the primary substrate across the membrane, accruing evidence on significant water transport and even uncoupled ion transport mediated by transporters has challenged the concept of perfect mechanical coupling and coordination of the gatingmechanismin transporters,which might be expected fromthe alternating access model. Here, we present a large set of extended equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations performed on several classes of membrane transporters in different conformational states, to test the presence of the phenomenon in diverse transporter classes and to investigate the underlying molecularmechanism ofwater transport through membrane transporters. The simulations reveal spontaneous formation of transient water-conducting (channel-like) states allowing passive water diffusion through the lumen of the transporters. These channel-like states are permeable to water but occluded to substrate, thereby not hindering the uphill transport of the primary substrate, i.e., the alternating access model remains applicable to the substrate. The rise of such water-conducting states during the large-scale structural transitions of the transporter protein is indicative of imperfections in the coordinated closing and opening motions of the cytoplasmic and extracellular gates.We propose that the observed water-conducting states likely represent a universal phenomenon in membrane transporters, which is consistent with their reliance on large-scale motion for function.},

abstract = {Sodium coupled cotransporters of the five-helix inverted repeat (5HIR) superfamily use an alternating access mechanism to transport a myriad of small molecules across the cell membrane. One of the primary steps in this mechanism is the conformational transition from a state poised to bind extracellular substrates to a state that is competent to deliver substrate to the cytoplasm. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the 5HIR benzylhydantoin transporter Mhp1 that incorporates experimental structures of the outward- and inward-open states to investigate the mechanism of this conformational change. Using the weighted ensemble path-sampling method, we rigorously sample the outward- to inward-facing transition path ensemble. The transition path ensemble reveals a heterogeneous set of pathways connecting the two states and identifies two modes of transport: one consistent with a strict alternating access mechanism and another where decoupling of the inner and outer gates causes the transient formation of a continuous permeation pathway through the transporter. We also show that the conformational switch between the outward- and inward-open states results from rigid body motions of the hash motif relative to the substrate bundle, supporting the rocking bundle hypothesis. Finally, our methodology provides the groundwork for more chemically detailed investigations of the alternating mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Mechanistic understanding of dynamic membrane proteins such as transporters, receptors, and channels requires accurate depictions of conformational ensembles, and the manner in which they interchange as a function of environmental factors including substrates, lipids, and inhibitors. Spectroscopic techniques such as electron spin resonance (ESR) pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR), also known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER), provide a complement to atomistic structures obtained from x-ray crystallography or cryo-EM, since spectroscopic data reflect an ensemble and can be measured in more native solvents, unperturbed by a crystal lattice. However, attempts to interpret DEER data are frequently stymied by discrepancies with the structural data, which may arise due to differences in conditions, the dynamics of the protein, or the flexibility of the attached paramagnetic spin labels. Recently, molecular simulation techniques such as EBMetaD have been developed that create a conformational ensemble matching an experimental distance distribution while applying the minimal possible bias. Moreover, it has been proposed that the work required during an EBMetaD simulation to match an experimentally determined distribution could be used as a metric with which to assign conformational states to a given measurement. Here, we demonstrate the application of this concept for a sodium-coupled transport protein, BetP. Because the probe, protein, and lipid bilayer are all represented in atomic detail, the different contributions to the work, such as the extent of protein backbone movements, can be separated. This work therefore illustrates how ranking simulations based on EBMetaD can help to bridge the gap between structural and biophysical data and thereby enhance our understanding of membrane protein conformational mechanisms.},

abstract = {Binding of Zn2+ to the endogenous Zn2+ binding site in the human dopamine transporter leads to potent inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake. Here we show that mutation of an intracellular tyrosine to alanine (Y335A) converts this inhibitory Zn2+ switch into an activating Zn2+ switch, allowing Zn2+-dependent activation of the transporter. The tyrosine is part of a conserved YXX$\Phi$ trafficking motif (X is any residue and $\Phi$ is a residue with a bulky hydrophobic group), but Y335A did not show alterations in surface targeting or protein kinase C-mediated internalization. Despite wild-type levels of surface expression, Y335A displayed a dramatic decrease in [3H]dopamine uptake velocity (Vmax) to less than 1% of the wild type. In addition, Y335A showed up to 150-fold decreases in the apparent affinity for cocaine, mazindol, and related inhibitors whereas the apparent affinity for several substrates was increased. However, the presence of Zn2+ in micromolar concentrations increased the Vmax up to 24-fold and partially restored the apparent affinities. The capability of Zn2+ to restore transport is consistent with a reversible, constitutive shift in the distribution of conformational states in the transport cycle upon mutation of Tyr-335. We propose that this shift is caused by disruption of intramolecular interactions important for stabilizing the transporter in a conformation in which extracellular substrate can bind and initiate transport, and accordingly that Tyr-335 is critical for regulating isomerization between discrete states in the transport cycle.},

The symporters for the biogenic amines serotonin (SERT), dopamine (DAT), and norepinephrine (NET) are targets of multiple psychoactive agents, and their dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric ailments. LeuT, a thermostable eubacterial NSS homolog, has been exploited as a model protein for NSS members to canvass the conformational mechanism of transport with a combination of X-ray crystallography, cysteine accessibility, and solution spectroscopy. Despite yielding remarkable insights, these studies have primarily been conducted with protein in the detergent-solubilized state rather than embedded in a membrane mimic. In addition, solution spectroscopy has required site-specific labeling of nonnative cysteines, a labor-intensive process occasionally resulting in diminished transport and/or binding activity. Here, we overcome these limitations by reconstituting unlabeled LeuT in phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs, subjecting them to hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and facilitating interpretation of the data with molecular dynamics simulations. The data point to changes of accessibility and dynamics of structural elements previously implicated in the transport mechanism, in particular transmembrane helices (TMs) 1a and 7 as well as extracellular loops (ELs) 2 and 4. The results therefore illuminate the value of this strategy for interrogating the conformational mechanism of the more clinically significant mammalian membrane proteins including SERT and DAT, neither of which tolerates complete removal of endogenous cysteines, and whose activity is heavily influenced by neighboring lipids.},

The mechanistic interpretation of HDX data, however, is often qualitative and subjective, owing to a lack of quantitative methods to rigorously translate observed deuteration levels into atomistic structural information. To help address this problem, we have developed a methodology to generate structural ensembles that faithfully reproduce HDX-MS measurements. In this approach, an ensemble of protein conformations is first generated, typically using molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-entropy bias is then applied post hoc to the resulting ensemble such that averaged peptide-deuteration levels, as predicted by an empirical model, agree with target values within a given level of uncertainty. We evaluate this approach, referred to as HDX ensemble reweighting (HDXer), for artificial target data reflecting the two major conformational states of a binding protein. We demonstrate that the information provided by HDX-MS experiments and by the model of exchange are sufficient to recover correctly weighted structural ensembles from simulations, even when the relevant conformations are rarely observed. Degrading the information content of the target dataâe.g., by reducing sequence coverage, by averaging exchange levels over longer peptide segments, or by incorporating different sources of uncertaintyâreduces the structural accuracy of the reweighted ensemble but still allows for useful insights into the distinctive structural features reflected by the target data. Finally, we describe a quantitative metric to rank candidate structural ensembles according to their correspondence with target data and illustrate the use of HDXer to describe changes in the conformational ensemble of the membrane protein LeuT. In summary, HDXer is designed to facilitate objective structural interpretations of HDX-MS data and to inform experimental approaches and further developments of theoretical exchange models.},

abstract = {Cys accessibility and quantitative intact mass spectrometry (MS) analyses have been devised to study the topological transitions of Mhp1, the membrane protein for sodium-linked transport of hydantoins from Microbacterium liquefaciens. Mhp1 has been crystallized in three forms (outward-facing open, outward-facing occluded with substrate bound, and inward-facing open). We show that one natural cysteine residue, Cys327, out of three, has an enhanced solvent accessibility in the inward-facing (relative to the outward-facing) form. Reaction of the purified protein, in detergent, with the thiol-reactive N-ethylmalemide (NEM), results in modification of Cys327, suggesting that Mhp1 adopts predominantly inward-facing conformations. Addition of either sodium ions or the substrate 5-benzyl-l-hydantoin (L-BH) does not shift this conformational equilibrium, but systematic co-addition of the two results in an attenuation of labeling, indicating a shift toward outward-facing conformations that can be interpreted using conventional enzyme kinetic analyses. Such measurements can afford the Km for each ligand as well as the stoichiometry of ion-substrate-coupled conformational changes. Mutations that perturb the substrate binding site either result in the protein being unable to adopt outward-facing conformations or in a global destabilization of structure. The methodology combines covalent labeling, mass spectrometry, and kinetic analyses in a straightforward workflow applicable to a range of systems, enabling the interrogation of changes in a protein's conformation required for function at varied concentrations of substrates, and the consequences of mutations on these conformational transitions.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters use electrochemical gradient of ions to fuel the âuphillâ translocation of the substrate following the alternating-access model. The coupling of ions to conformational dynamics of the protein remains one of the least characterized aspects of the transporter function. We employ extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the Na+-binding effects on the structure and dynamics of a LeuT-fold, Na+-coupled secondary transporter (Mhp1) in its major conformational states, i.e., the outward-facing (OF) and inward-facing (IF) states, as well as on the OF â IF state transition. Microsecond-long, unbiased MD simulations illustrate that Na+ stabilizes an OF conformation favorable for substrate association, by binding to a highly conserved site at the interface between the two helical bundles and restraining their relative position and motion. Furthermore, a special-protocol biased simulation for state transition suggests that Na+ binding hinders the OF â IF transition. These synergistic Na+-binding effects allosterically couple the ion and substrate binding sites and modify the kinetics of state transition, collectively increasing the lifetime of an OF conformation with high substrate affinity, thereby facilitating substrate recruitment from a low-concentration environment. Based on the similarity between our findings for Mhp1 and experimental reports on LeuT, we propose that this model may represent a general Na+-coupling mechanism among LeuT-fold transporters.},

abstract = {X-ray crystal structures have revealed that numerous secondary transporter proteins originally categorized into different sequence families share similar structures, namely, the LeuT fold. The core of this fold consists of two units of five transmembrane helices, whose conformations have been proposed to exchange to form the two alternate states required for transport. That these two units are related implies that LeuT-like transporters evolved from gene-duplication and fusion events. Thus, the origins of this structural repeat may be relevant to the evolution of transport function. However, the lack of significant sequence similarity requires sensitive sequence search methods for analyzing their evolution. To this end, we developed a software application called AlignMe, which can use various types of input information, such as residue hydrophobicity, to perform pairwise alignments of sequences and/or of hydropathy profiles of (membrane) proteins. We used AlignMe to analyze the evolutionary relationships between repeats of the LeuT fold. In addition, we identified proteins from the so-called DedA family that potentially share a common ancestor with these repeats. DedA domains have been implicated in, e.g., selenite uptake; they are found widely distributed across all kingdoms of life; two or more DedA domains are typically found per genome, and some may adopt dual topologies. These results suggest that DedA proteins existed in ancient organisms and may function as dimers, as required for a would-be ancestor of the LeuT fold. In conclusion, we provide novel insights into the evolution of this important structural motif and thus potentially into the alternating-access mechanism of transport itself. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

Members of this superfamily fall into 10 well-defined families that are either prokaryote specific, eukaryote specific or ubiquitous. Most of these proteins exhibit 12 probable transmembrane spanners (TMSs), but members of two of these families deviate from this pattern, exhibiting 10 and 14 TMSs. All members of these families are tabulated, their functional properties are reviewed and phylogenetic/sequence analyses define the evolutionary relationships of the proteins to each other. Evidence is presented that the APC superfamily may include two other currently recognized families that exhibit greater degrees of sequence divergence from APC superfamily members than do the proteins of the 10 established families from each other. At least some of the protein members of these two distantly related families exhibit 11 established TMSs. Altogether, the APC superfamily probably includes 12 currently recognized families with members that exhibit exclusive specificity for amino acids and their derivatives but which can possess 10, 11, 12 or 14 TMSs per polypeptide chain.},

The proposed pathway for the evolutionary appearance of the five types of transport proteins involved intragenic duplication of transmembrane pore-forming peptide-encoding genes, giving rise to channel proteins. These gave rise to single protein secondary carriers which upon superimposition of addition protein domains and proteins, including energy-coupling proteins and extracytoplasmic receptors, gave rise to multidomain, multicomponent carriers, primary active transporters and group translocators.

Recent high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data have shown that four additional transporter families (BCCT, TC No. 2.A.15; SSS, 2.A.21; NSS, 2.A.22; and NCS1, 2.A.39), transporting a wide range of solutes, exhibit sufficiently similar folds to suggest a common evolutionary origin. We have used established statistical methods, based on sequence similarity, to show that these families are, in fact, members of the APC superfamily. We also identify two additional families (NCS2, 2.A.40; SulP, 2.A.53) as being members of this superfamily. Repeat sequences, each having five transmembrane $\alpha$-helical segments and arising via ancient intragenic duplications, are demonstrated for all of these families, further strengthening the conclusion of homology. The APC superfamily appears to be the second largest superfamily of secondary carriers, the largest being the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Although the topology of the members of the APC superfamily differs from that of the MFS, both families appear to have arisen from a common ancestral 2 TMS hairpin structure that underwent intragenic triplication followed by loss of a TMS in the APC family, to give the repeat units that are characteristic of these two superfamilies.

However, the evolutionary relationship between the 5+5 and the 7+7 topological types has not been established. We have identified a common fold, consisting of a spiny membrane helix/sheet, followed by a U-like structure and a V-like structure that is recurrent between domain duplicated units of 5+5 and 7+7 inverted repeat folds. This fold is found in the following protein structures: AdiC, ApcT, LeuT, Mhp1, BetP, CaiT, and SglT (all 5+5 TMS repeats), as well as UraA and SulP (7+7 TMS repeats). AdiC, LeuT and Mhp1 have two extra TMSs after the second duplicated domain, SglT has four extra C-terminal TMSs, and BetP has two extra TMSs before the first duplicated domain. UraA and SulP on the other hand have two extra TMSs at the N-terminus of each duplicated domain unit. These observations imply that multiple hairpin and domain duplication events occurred during the evolution of the APC superfamily. We suggest that the five TMS architecture was primordial and that families gained two TMSs on either side of this basic structure via dissimilar hairpin duplications either before or after intragenic duplication. Evidence for homology between TMSs 1-2 of AdiC and TMSs 1-2 and 3-4 of UraA suggests that the 7+7 topology arose via an internal duplication of the N-terminal hairpin loop within the five TMS repeat unit followed by duplication of the 7 TMS domain. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, the molecular knowledge of how surrounding lipids affect membrane transport is surprisingly limited and despite its general importance is rarely considered in the molecular description of a transport mechanism. One reason is that only few atomic resolution structures of channels or transporters reveal a functional interaction with lipids, which are difficult to detect in X-ray structures per se. Overcoming these difficulties, we report here on a new structure of the osmotic stress-regulated betaine transporter BetP in complex with anionic lipids. This lipid-associated BetP structure is important in the molecular understanding of osmoregulation due to the strong dependence of activity regulation in BetP on the presence of negatively charged lipids. We detected eight resolved palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) lipids mimicking parts of the membrane leaflets and interacting with key residues in transport and regulation. The lipid-protein interactions observed here in structural detail in BetP provide molecular insights into the role of lipids in osmoregulated secondary transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

Major depression and anxiety disorders are treated using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsâsmall molecules that competitively block substrate binding and thereby prolong neurotransmitter action2,4. The dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, together with SERT, are members of the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) family. The transport activities of NSSs can be inhibited or modulated by cocaine and amphetamines2,3, and genetic variants of NSSs are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and bipolar disorder2,5. Studies of bacterial NSS homologuesâincluding LeuTâhave shown how their transmembrane helices (TMs) undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle, exposing a central binding site to either side of the membrane1,6â12. However, the conformational changes associated with transport in NSSs remain unknown. To elucidate structure-based mechanisms for transport in SERT we investigated its complexes with ibogaine, a hallucinogenic natural product with psychoactive and anti-addictive properties13,14. Notably, ibogaine is a non-competitive inhibitor of transport but displays competitive binding towards selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors15,16. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of SERTâibogaine complexes captured in outward-open, occluded and inward-open conformations. Ibogaine binds to the central binding site, and closure of the extracellular gate largely involves movements of TMs 1b and 6a. Opening of the intracellular gate involves a hinge-like movement of TM1a and the partial unwinding of TM5, which together create a permeation pathway that enables substrate and ion diffusion to the cytoplasm. These structures define the structural rearrangements that occur from the outward-open to inward-open conformations, and provide insight into the mechanism of neurotransmitter transport and ibogaine inhibition.},

abstract = {Computational de novo protein structure prediction is limited to small proteins of simple topology. The present work explores an approach to extend beyond the current limitations through assembling protein topologies from idealized $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands. The algorithm performs a Monte Carlo Metropolis simulated annealing folding simulation. It optimizes a knowledge-based potential that analyzes radius of gyration, $\beta$-strand pairing, secondary structure element (SSE) packing, amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, contact order, secondary structure prediction agreement and loop closure. Discontinuation of the protein chain favors sampling of non-local contacts and thereby creation of complex protein topologies. The folding simulation is accelerated through exclusion of flexible loop regions further reducing the size of the conformational search space. The algorithm is benchmarked on 66 proteins with lengths between 83 and 293 amino acids. For 61 out of these proteins, the best SSE-only models obtained have an RMSD100 below 8.0 {\AA} and recover more than 20% of the native contacts. The algorithm assembles protein topologies with up to 215 residues and a relative contact order of 0.46. The method is tailored to be used in conjunction with low-resolution or sparse experimental data sets which often provide restraints for regions of defined secondary structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 KarakaÅ et al.},

abstract = {We present a fast ab initio method for the prediction of local conformations in proteins. The program, PETRA, selects polypeptide fragments from a computer-generated database (APD) encoding all possible peptide fragments up to twelve amino acids long. Each fragment is defined by a representative set of eight $\phi$/$\psi$ pairs, obtained iteratively from a trial set by calculating how fragments generated from them represent the protein databank (PDB). Ninety-six percent (96%) of length five fragments in crystal structures, with a resolution better than 1.5 {\AA} and less than 25% identity, have a conformer in the database with less than 1 k root-mean-square deviation (rmsd). In order to select segments from APD, PETRA uses a set of simple rule-based filters, thus reducing the number of potential conformations to a manageable total. This reduced set is scored and sorted using rmsd fit to the anchor regions and a knowledge-based energy function dependent on the sequence to be modelled. The best scoring fragments can then be optimized by minimization of contact potentials and rmsd fit to the core model. The quality of the prediction made by PETRA is evaluated by calculating both the differences in rmsd and backbone torsion angles between the final model and the native fragment. The average rmsd ranges from 1.4 k for three residue loops to 3.9 {\AA} for eight residue loops. (C) 2000 Wiley- Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {A model for an antibody specific for the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been constructed using a method which combines the concept of canonical structure with conformational search. A conformational search technique is introduced which couples random generation of backbone loop conformations to a simulated annealing method for assigning side chain conformations. This technique was used both to verify conformations selected from the set of known canonical structures and to explore conformations available at the H3 loop in CEA ab initio. Canonical structures are not available for H3 due to its variability in length, sequence, and observed conformation in known antibody structures Analysis of the results of conformational search resulted in three equally probable conformations for H3 loop in CEA. Force field energies, solvation free energies, exposure of charged residues and burial of hydrophobic residues, and packing of hydrophobic residues at the base of the loop were used as selection criteria. The existence of three equally plausible structures may reflect the high degree of flexibility expected for an exposed loop of this length. The nature of the combining site and features which could be important to interaction with antigen are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992 WileyâLiss, Inc.

abstract = {We describe the methodology and results from our participation in the second Antibody Modeling Assessment experiment. During the experiment we predicted the structure of eleven unpublished antibody Fv fragments. Our prediction methods centered on template-based modeling; potential templates were selected from an antibody database based on their sequence similarity to the target in the framework regions. Depending on the quality of the templates, we constructed models of the antibody framework regions either using a single, chimeric or multiple template approach. The hypervariable loop regions in the initial models were rebuilt by grafting the corresponding regions from suitable templates onto the model. For the H3 loop region, we further refined models using ab initio methods. The final models were subjected to constrained energy minimization to resolve severe local structural problems. The analysis of the models submitted show that Accelrys tools allow for the construction of quite accurate models for the framework and the canonical CDR regions, with RMSDs to the X-ray structure on average below 1 {\AA} for most of these regions. The results show that accurate prediction of the H3 hypervariable loops remains a challenge. Furthermore, model quality assessment of the submitted models show that the models are of quite high quality, with local geometry assessment scores similar to that of the target X-ray structures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Motivation: Loops are often vital for protein function, however, their irregular structures make them difficult to model accurately. Current loop modelling algorithms can mostly be divided into two categories: knowledge-based, where databases of fragments are searched to find suitable conformations and ab initio, where conformations are generated computationally. Existing knowledge-based methods only use fragments that are the same length as the target, even though loops of slightly different lengths may adopt similar conformations. Here, we present a novel method, Sphinx, which combines ab initio techniques with the potential extra structural information contained within loops of a different length to improve structure prediction. Results: We show that Sphinx is able to generate high-accuracy predictions and decoy sets enriched with near-native loop conformations, performing better than the ab initio algorithm on which it is based. In addition, it is able to provide predictions for every target, unlike some knowledge-based methods. Sphinx can be used successfully for the difficult problem of antibody H3 prediction, outperforming RosettaAntibody, one of the leading H3-specific ab initio methods, both in accuracy and speed.},

The average root mean square deviation ranged from 0.78 A for three residue loops to 3.5 A for eight residue loops on a nonhomologous test set. CODA clusters the predictions from the two independent programs and makes a consensus prediction that must pass a set of rule-based filters. CODA was parameterized and tested on two unrelated separate sets of structures that were nonhomologous to one another and those found in the FREAD database. The average root mean square deviation in the test set ranged from 0.76 A for three residue loops to 3.09 A for eight residue loops. CODA shows a general improvement in loop prediction over PETRA and FREAD individually. The improvement is far more marked for lengths six and upward, probably as the predictive power of PETRA becomes more important.

Here, a new analytic/iterative algorithm denoted random coordinate descent (RCD) to perform protein loop closure is described. The algorithm solves loop closure through minimization as in cyclic coordinate descent but selects bonds for optimization randomly, updates loop conformations by spinor-matrices, performs loop closure in both chain directions, and uses a set of geometric filters to yield efficient conformational sampling. Geometric filters allow one to detect clashes and constrain dihedral angles on the fly. The RCD algorithm is at least comparable to state of the art loop closure algorithms due to an excellent balance between efficiency and intrinsic sampling capability. Furthermore, its efficiency allows one to improve conformational sampling by increasing the sampling number without much penalty. Overall, RCD turns out to be accurate, fast, robust, and applicable over a wide range of loop lengths. Because of the versatility of RCD, it is a solid alternative for integration with current loop modeling strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {To accurately predict protein conformations in atomic detail, a computational method must be capable of sampling models sufficiently close to the native structure. All-atom sampling is difficult because of the vast number of possible conformations and extremely rugged energy landscapes. Here, we test three sampling strategies to address these difficulties: conformational diversification, intensification of torsion and omega-angle sampling and parameter annealing. We evaluate these strategies in the context of the robotics-based kinematic closure (KIC) method for local conformational sampling in Rosetta on an established benchmark set of 45 12-residue protein segments without regular secondary structure. We quantify performance as the fraction of sub-Angstrom models generated. While improvements with individual strategies are only modest, the combination of intensification and annealing strategies into a new "next-generation KIC" method yields a four-fold increase over standard KIC in the median percentage of sub-Angstrom models across the dataset. Such improvements enable progress on more difficult problems, as demonstrated on longer segments, several of which could not be accurately remodeled with previous methods. Given its improved sampling capability, next-generation KIC should allow advances in other applications such as local conformational remodeling of multiple segments simultaneously, flexible backbone sequence design, and development of more accurate energy functions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Stein, Kortemme.},

The resulting decoys are then further optimized in backbone and side-chain conformations and ranked by all-atom energy scoring functions. The final integrated technique called loop prediction by energy-assisted protocol achieved a median value of 2.1 {\AA} root mean square deviation (RMSD) for 325 12-residue test loops and 2.0 {\AA} RMSD for 45 12-residue loops from critical assessment of structure-prediction techniques (CASP) 10 target proteins with native core structures (backbone and side chains).

abstract = {Protein loop modeling is a tool for predicting protein local structures of particular interest, providing opportunities for applications involving protein structure prediction and de novo protein design. Until recently, themajority of loopmodelingmethods have been developed and tested by reconstructing loops in frameworks of experimentally resolved structures. In many practical applications, however, the protein loops to be modeled are located in inaccurate structural environments. These include loops in model structures, low-resolution experimental structures, or experimental structures of different functional forms. Accordingly, discrepancies in the accuracy of the structural environment assumed in development of the method and that in practical applications present additional challenges to modern loop modeling methods. This study demonstrates a new strategy for employing a hybrid energy function combining physics-based and knowledge-based components to help tackle this challenge. The hybrid energy function is designed to combine the strengths of each energy component, simultaneously maintaining accurate loop structure prediction in a highresolution framework structure and tolerating minor environmental errors in lowresolution structures. A loop modeling method based on global optimization of this new energy function is tested on loop targets situated in different levels of environmental errors, ranging from experimental structures to structures perturbed in backbone as well as side chains and template-based model structures. The new method performs comparably to force field-based approaches in loop reconstruction in crystal structures and better in loop prediction in inaccurate framework structures. This result suggests that higher-accuracy predictions would be possible for a broader range of applications. The web server for this method is available at http://galaxy. seoklab.org/loop with the PS2 option for the scoring function.},

Applied to three different template-based test sets, DaReUS-Loop shows significant increase in the number of high-accuracy loops, and significant enhancement for modeling long loops. A special advantage is that our method proposes a prediction confidence score that correlates well with the expected accuracy of the loops.

abstract = {Loops are the most variable regions of protein structure and are, in general, the least accurately predicted. Their prediction has been approached in two ways, ab initio and database search. In recent years, it has been thought that ab initio methods are more powerful. In light of the continued rapid expansion in the number of known protein structures, we have re-evaluated FREAD, a database search method and demonstrate that the power of database search methods may have been underestimated. We found that sequence similarity as quantified by environment specific substitution scores can be used to significantly improve prediction. In fact, FREAD performs appreciably better for an identifiable subset of loops (two thirds of shorter loops and half of the longer loops tested) than the ab initio methods of MODELLER, PLOP, and RAPPER. Within this subset, FREAD's predictive ability is length independent, in general, producing results within 2A RMSD, compared to an average of over 10{\AA} for loop length 20 for any of the other tested methods. We also benchmarked the prediction protocols on a set of 212 loops from the model structures in CASP 7 and 8. An extended version of FREAD is able to make predictions for 127 of these, it gives the best prediction of the methods tested in 61 of these cases. In examining FREAD's ability to predict in the model environment, we found that whole structure quality did not affect the quality of loop predictions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {SuperLooper provides the first online interface for the automatic, quick and interactive search and placement of loops in proteins (LIP). A database containing half a billion segments of water-soluble proteins with lengths up to 35 residues can be screened for candidate loops. A specified database containing 180 000 membrane loops in proteins (LIMP) can be searched, alternatively. Loop candidates are scored based on sequence criteria and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the stem atoms. Searching LIP, the average global RMSD of the respective top-ranked loops to the original loops is benchmarked to be <2 {\AA}, for loops up to six residues or <3 {\AA} for loops shorter than 10 residues. Other suitable conformations may be selected and directly visualized on the web server from a top-50 list. For user guidance, the sequence homology between the template and the original sequence, proline or glycine exchanges or close contacts between a loop candidate and the remainder of the protein are denoted. For membrane proteins, the expansions of the lipid bilayer are automatically modeled using the TMDET algorithm. This allows the user to select the optimal membrane protein loop concerning its relative orientation to the lipid bilayer. The server is online since October 2007 and can be freely accessed at URL: http://bioinformatics.charite.de/superlooper/.},

abstract = {The application of all-atom force fields (and explicit or implicit solvent models) to protein homology-modeling tasks such as side-chain and loop prediction remains challenging both because of the expense of the individual energy calculations and because of the difficulty of sampling the rugged all-atom energy surface. Here we address this challenge for the problem of loop prediction through the development of numerous new algorithms, with an emphasis on multiscale and hierarchical techniques. As a first step in evaluating the performance of our loop prediction algorithm, we have applied it to the problem of reconstructing loops in native structures; we also explicitly include crystal packing to provide a fair comparison with crystal structures. In brief, large numbers of loops are generated by using a dihedral angle-based buildup procedure followed by iterative cycles of clustering, side-chain optimization, and complete energy minimization of selected loop structures. We evaluate this method by using the largest test set yet used for validation of a loop prediction method, with a total of 833 loops ranging from 4 to 12 residues in length. Average/median backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) to the native structures (superimposing the body of the protein, not the loop itself) are 0.42/0.24 {\AA} for 5 residue loops, 1.00/0.44 {\AA} for 8 residue loops, and 2.47/1.83 {\AA} for 11 residue loops. Median RMSDs are substantially lower than the averages because of a small number of outliers; the causes of these failures are examined in some detail, and many can be attributed to errors in assignment of protonation states of titratable residues, omission of ligands from the simulation, and, in a few cases, probable errors in the experimentally determined structures. When these obvious problems in the data sets are filtered out, average RMSDs to the native structures improve to 0.43 {\AA} for 5 residue loops, 0.84 {\AA} for 8 residue loops, and 1.63 {\AA} for 11 residue loops. In the vast majority of cases, the method locates energy minima that are lower than or equal to that of the minimized native loop, thus indicating that sampling rarely limits prediction accuracy. The overall results are, to our knowledge, the best reported to date, and we attribute this success to the combination of an accurate all-atom energy function, efficient methods for loop buildup and side-chain optimization, and, especially for the longer loops, the hierarchical refinement protocol. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Accurately modeling protein loops is an important step to predict three-dimensional structures as well as to understand functions of many proteins. Because of their high flexibility, modeling the three-dimensional structures of loops is difficult and is usually treated as a "mini protein folding problem" under geometric constraints. In the past decade, there has been remarkable progress in template-free loop structure modeling due to advances of computational methods as well as stably increasing number of known structures available in PDB. This mini review provides an overview on the recent computational approaches for loop structure modeling. In particular, we focus on the approaches of sampling loop conformation space, which is a critical step to obtain high resolution models in template-free methods. We review the potential energy functions for loop modeling, loop buildup mechanisms to satisfy geometric constraints, and loop conformation sampling algorithms. The recent loop modeling results are also summarized.},

abstract = {The determination of macromolecular structures from experimental data is an ill-posed inverse problem. Nevertheless, conventional techniques to structure determination attempt an inversion of the data by minimization of a target function. This approach leads to problems if the data are sparse, noisy, heterogeneous, or difficult to describe theoretically. We propose here to view biomolecular structure determination as an inference rather than an inversion problem. Probability theory then offers a consistent formalism to solve any structure determination problem: We use Bayes' theorem to derive a probability distribution for the atomic coordinates and all additional unknowns. This distribution represents the complete information contained in the data and can be analyzed numerically by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. We apply our method to data obtained from a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment and discuss the estimation of theory parameters. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Covalent labeling mass spectrometry experiments are growing in popularity and provide important information regarding protein structure. Information obtained from these experiments correlates with residue solvent exposure within the protein in solution. However, it is impossible to determine protein structure from covalent labeling data alone. Incorporation of sparse covalent labeling data into the protein structure prediction software Rosetta has been shown to improve protein tertiary structure prediction. Here, covalent labeling techniques were analyzed computationally to provide insight into what labeling data is needed to optimize tertiary protein structure prediction in Rosetta. We have successfully implemented a new scoring functionality that provides improved predictions. We developed two new covalent labeling based score terms that use a "cone"-based neighbor count to quantify the relative solvent exposure of each amino acid. To test our method, we used a set of 20 proteins with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Decoy model sets were generated for each of these 20 proteins, and the normalized covalent labeling score versus RMSD distributions were evaluated. On the basis of these distributions, we have determined an optimal subset of residues to use when performing covalent labeling experiments in order to maximize the structure prediction capabilities of the covalent labeling data. We also investigated how much false negative and false positive data can be tolerated without meaningfully impacting protein structure prediction. Using these new covalent labeling score terms, protein models were rescored and the resulting models improved by 3.9 {\AA} RMSD on average. New models were also generated using Rosetta's AbinitioRelax program under the guidance of covalent labeling information, and improvement in model quality was observed.},

abstract = {Membrane-protein design is an exciting and increasingly successful research area which has led to landmarks including the design of stable and accurate membrane-integral proteins based on coiled-coil motifs. Design of topologically more complex proteins, such as most receptors, channels, and transporters, however, demands an energy function that balances contributions from intra-protein contacts and protein-membrane interactions. Recent advances in water-soluble all-atom energy functions have increased the accuracy in structure-prediction benchmarks. The plasma membrane, however, imposes different physical constraints on protein solvation. To understand these constraints, we recently developed a high-throughput experimental screen, called dsT$\beta$L, and inferred apparent insertion energies for each amino acid at dozens of positions across the bacterial plasma membrane. Here, we express these profiles as lipophilicity energy terms in Rosetta and demonstrate that the new energy function outperforms previous ones in modelling and design benchmarks. Rosetta ab initio simulations starting from an extended chain recapitulate two-thirds of the experimentally determined structures of membrane-spanning homo-oligomers with <2.5{\AA} root-mean-square deviation within the top-predicted five models (available online: http://tmhop.weizmann.ac.il). Furthermore, in two sequence-design benchmarks, the energy function improves discrimination of stabilizing point mutations and recapitulates natural membrane-protein sequences of known structure, thereby recommending this new energy function for membrane-protein modelling and design.},

abstract = {The structure of the lysozyme from bacteriophage T4 has been refined at 1.7 {\AA} resolution to a crystallographic residual of 19.3%. The final model has bond lengths and bond angles that differ from "ideal" values by 0.019 {\AA} and 2.7 Â°, respectively. The crystals are grown from electron-dense phosphate solutions and the use of an appropriate solvent continuum substantially improved the agreement between the observed and calculated structure factors at low resolution. Apart from changes in the conformations of some side-chains, the refinement confirms the structure of the molecule as initially derived from a 2.4 {\AA} resolution electron density map. There are 118 well-ordered solvent molecules that are associated with the T4 lysozyme molecule in the crystal. Four of these are more-or-less buried. There is a clustering of water molecules within the active site cleft but, other than this, the solvent molecules are dispersed around the surface of the molecule and do not aggregate into ice-like structures or pentagonal or hexagonal clusters. The apparent motion of T4 lysozyme in the crystal can be interpreted in terms of significant interdomain motion corresponding to an opening and closing of the active site cleft. For the amino-terminal domain the motion can be described equally well (correlation coefficients approx. 0.87) as quasi-rigid-body motion either about a point or about an axis of rotation. The motion in the crystals of the carboxy-terminal domain is best described as rotation about an axis (correlation coefficient 0.80) although in this case the apparent motion seems to be influenced in part by crystal contacts and may be of questionable relevance to dynamics in solution. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

The spectral line shapes were analyzed as a function of side chain structure and temperature using a simulation method with a single order parameter and diffusion rates about three orthogonal axes as parameters. Taken together, the results provide strong support for an anisotropic motional model of the side chain, which was previously proposed from qualitative features of the spectra and crystal structures of spin labeled T4 lysozyme. Site-specific differences in apparent order parameter are interpreted in terms of backbone dynamics modes with characteristic correlation times in the nanosecond or faster time scale.

When applied to de novo protein design, this approach designs sequences with an amino acid distribution near the native amino acid distribution in membrane proteins, overcoming a critical flaw in previous membrane models that were prone to generating leucine-rich designs. Furthermore, the proteins designed in the new membrane model exhibit native-like features including interfacial aromatic side chains, hydrophobic lengths compatible with bilayer thickness, and polar pores.

Recently, it has been argued that all cold-adapted enzymes with catalytic efficiency greater than that of their mesophilic counterparts display local flexibility or rigidity that are likely to cooperate, each acting on specific areas of the enzyme structure. Here we report an analysis of the normalized thermal B-factor distributions in psychrophilic proteins compared with those of their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts with the aim to detect statistically significant local variations of relative backbone flexibility possibly linked to cold adaptation. We utilized a strategy based mainly on intra-family comparison of local distribution of normalized B-factors. After careful statistical treatment of data, the picture emerging from our results suggests that the distribution of the flexibility in psychrophilic enzymes is locally more heterogeneous than in their respective mesophilic homologues. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The factors contributing to the thermal stability of proteins from thermophilic origins are matters of intense debate and investigation. Thermophilic proteins are thought to possess better packed interiors than their mesophilic counterparts, leading to lesser overall flexibility and a corresponding reduction in surface-to-volume ratio. These observations prompted an analysis of B values reported in high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. In this analysis, the following aspects were addressed: (1) frequency distribution of normalized B values (B' factors) over all the proteins and for individual amino acids; (2) amino acid compositions in high B value regions of polypeptide chains; (3) variation in the B values from core to the surface of proteins in terms of their radius of gyration; and (4) degree of dispersion of normalized B values in spheres around the C$\alpha$ atoms. The analysis revealed that (1) Ser and Thr have lesser flexibility in thermophiles than in mesophiles, (2) the proportion of Glu and Lys in high B value regions of thermophiles is higher and that of Ser and Thr is lower and (3) the dispersion of B values within spheres at Ca atoms is similar in mesophiles and thermophiles. These observations reflect plausible differences in the dynamics of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins and suggest amino acid substitutions that are likely to change thermal stability.},

abstract = {When partitioning a set of objects into k clusters, the main objective is to find clusters the objects of which show a high degree of similarity. There are several possible criteria for quantifying this objective, the best known of which are based on sums of squares. An alternative approach, used in the k-medoid method, is of the L 1 type. It searches for k `representative' objects, called medoids, which minimize the average dissimilarity of all objects of the data set to the nearest medoid. A cluster is then defined as the set of objects which have been assigned to the same medoid. An algorithm for this method has been implemented in the PAM program which is described in the paper. The k-medoid method offers the advantage of not requiring the actual measurement data, as it can also be applied to a collection of dissimilarities. Such dissimilarities are for example subjective assessments of relationships between objects, in which case no measurements exist. An example of the latter type is analyzed. Furthermore, the k-medoid method is less susceptible to outlying values},

abstract = {A central tenet of biology is that globular proteins have a unique 3D structure under physiological conditions. Recent work has challenged this notion by demonstrating that some proteins switch folds, a process that involves remodeling of secondary structure in response to a few mutations (evolved fold switchers) or cellular stimuli (extant fold switchers). To date, extant fold switchers have been viewed as rare byproducts of evolution, but their frequency has been neither quantified nor estimated. By systematically and exhaustively searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we found â¼100 extant fold-switching proteins. Furthermore, we gathered multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these proteins are widespread in nature. Based on these lines of evidence, we hypothesized that the frequency of extant fold-switching proteins may be underrepresented by the structures in the PDB. Thus, we sought to identify other putative extant fold switchers with only one solved conformation. To do this, we identified two characteristic features of our â¼100 extant fold-switching proteins, incorrect secondary structure predictions and likely independent folding cooperativity, and searched the PDB for other proteins with similar features. Reassuringly, this method identified dozens of other proteins in the literature with indication of a structural change but only one solved conformation in the PDB. Thus, we used it to estimate that 0.5â4% of PDB proteins switch folds. These results demonstrate that extant fold-switching proteins are likely more common than the PDB reflects, which has implications for cell biology, genomics, and human health.},

abstract = {Integrative structure determination of macromolecular assemblies requires specifying the representation of the modeled structure, a scoring function for ranking alternative models based on diverse types of data, and a sampling method for generating these models. Structures are often represented at atomic resolution, although ad hoc simplified representations based on generic guidelines and/or trial and error are also used. In contrast, we introduce here the concept of optimizing representation. To illustrate this concept, the optimal representation is selected from a set of candidate representations based on an objective criterion that depends on varying amounts of information available for different parts of the structure. Specifically, an optimal representation is defined as the highest-resolution representation for which sampling is exhaustive at a precision commensurate with the precision of the representation. Thus, the method does not require an input structure and is applicable to any input information. We consider a space of representations in which a representation is a set of nonoverlapping, variable-length segments (i.e., coarse-grained beads) for each component protein sequence. We also implement a method for efficiently finding an optimal representation in our open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software (https://integrativemodeling.org/). The approach is illustrated by application to three complexes of two subunits and a large assembly of 10 subunits. The optimized representation facilitates exhaustive sampling and thus can produce a more accurate model and a more accurate estimate of its uncertainty for larger structures than were possible previously.},

Within a single crystal, the oriented ensemble of spin bearing moieties results in a strong angle dependence of the EPR spectra. A quantitative description of the EPR spectra requires the determination of the unit cell orientation with respect to the sample tube and the orientation of the spin bearing moieties within the crystal lattice. Angle dependent EPR spectra were analyzed by line shape simulations using the stochastic Liouville equation approach developed by Freed and co-workers and an effective Hamiltonian approach. The gain in spectral information obtained from the EPR spectra of single crystalline samples taken at different frequencies, namely the X-band and Q-band, allows us to discriminate between motional models describing the spectra of isotropic solutions similarly well. In addition, it is shown that the angle dependent single crystal spectra allow us to identify two spin label rotamers with very similar side chain dynamics. These results demonstrate the utility of single crystal EPR spectroscopy in combination with spectral line shape simulation techniques to extract valuable dynamic information not readily available from the analysis of isotropic systems. In addition, it will be shown that the loss of electron density in high resolution diffraction experiments at room temperature does not allow us to conclude that there is significant structural disorder in the system.},

abstract = {Pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is being applied to ever more complex biological systems comprising multiple subunits. Membrane channel proteins are of great interest as pulse EPR reports on functionally significant but distinct conformational states in a native environment without the need for crystallization. Pulse EPR, in the form of pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR), using site-directed spin labeling, is most commonly employed to accurately determine distances (in the nanometer range) between different regions of the structure. However, PELDOR data analysis is more challenging in systems containing more than two spins (e.g., homomultimers) due to distorting multispin effects. Without suppression of these effects, much of the information contained in PELDOR data cannot be reliably retrieved. Thus, it is of utmost importance for future PELDOR applications in structural biology to develop suitable approaches that can overcome the multispin problem. Here, two different approaches for suppressing multispin effects in PELDOR, sparse labeling of the protein (reducing the labeling efficiency f) and reducing the excitation probability of spins ($\lambda$), are compared on two distinct bacterial mechanosensitive channels. For both the pentameric channel of large conductance (MscL) and the heptameric channel of small conductance (MscS) of Escherichia coli, mutants containing a spin label in the cytosolic or the transmembrane region were tested. Data demonstrate that distance distributions can be significantly improved with either approach compared to the standard PELDOR measurement, and confirm that $\lambda$ < 1/(nâ1) is needed to sufficiently suppress multispin effects (with n being the number of spins in the system). A clear advantage of the sparse labeling approach is demonstrated for the cytosolic mutants due to a significantly smaller loss in sensitivity. For the transmembrane mutants, this advantage is less pronounced but still useful for MscS, but performance is inferior for MscL possibly due to structural perturbations by the bulkier diamagnetic spin label analog.},

For distances below 5 nm, a linear superposition of the signals of the shells is sufficient. The dipolar time evolution data can be separated into this linear contribution and a nonlinear background. The linear contribution can then be converted directly to a radial distribution function. For a series of shape-persistent and flexible biradicals with end-to-end distances between 2 and 5 nm, shell factorization and direct conversion of the data are in good agreement with each other and with force-field computations of the end-to-end distances.

Crystal structures for the dimeric cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (cdb3) and for a 12-ankyrin repeat segment (repeats 13-24) from the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R (AnkD34) have been reported. However, structural data on how these proteins assemble to form a stable complex have not been reported. In the current studies, site-directed spin labeling, in combination with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron-electron resonance, has been utilized to map the binding interfaces of the two proteins in the complex and to obtain inter-protein distance constraints. These data have been utilized to construct a family of structural models that are consistent with the full range of experimental data. These models indicate that an extensive area on the peripheral domain of cdb3 binds to ankyrin repeats 18-20 on the top loop surface of AnkD34 primarily through hydrophobic interactions. This is a previously uncharacterized surface for binding of cdb3 to AnkD34. Because a second dimer of cdb3 is known to bind to ankyrin repeats 7-12 of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R, the current models have significant implications regarding the structural nature of a tetrameric form of AE1 that is hypothesized to be involved in binding to full-length ankyrin-R in the erythrocyte membrane. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for understanding the conformational heterogeneity of proteins. It involves attaching nitroxide spin labels to two residues in the protein to obtain a distance distribution between them. However, the choice of residue pairs to label in the protein requires careful thought, as experimentalists must pick label positions from a large set of all possible residue-pair combinations in the protein. In this article, we address the problem of the choice of DEER spin-label positions in a protein. For this purpose, we utilize all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of protein dynamics, to rank the sets of labeled residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Our design methodology is based on the following two criteria: (1) An ideal set of DEER spin-label positions should capture the slowest conformational-change processes observed in the protein dynamics, and (2) any two sets of residue pairs should describe orthogonal conformational-change processes to maximize the overall information gain and reduce the number of labeled residue pairs. We utilize Markov state models of protein dynamics to identify slow dynamical processes and a genetic-algorithm-based approach to predict the optimal choices of residue pairs with limited computational time requirements. We predict the optimal residue pairs for DEER spectroscopy in $\beta$2 adrenergic receptor, the C-terminal domain of calmodulin, and peptide transporter PepTSo. We find that our choices were ranked higher than those used to perform DEER experiments on the proteins investigated in this study. Hence, the predicted choices of DEER residue pairs determined by our method provide maximum insight into the conformational heterogeneity of the protein while using the minimum number of labeled residues.},

abstract = {Despite advances in sampling and scoring strategies, Monte Carlo modeling methods still struggle to accurately predict de novo the structures of large proteins, membrane proteins, or proteins of complex topologies. Previous approaches have addressed these shortcomings by leveraging sparse distance data gathered using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to improve protein structure prediction and refinement outcomes. However, existing computational implementations entail compromises between coarse-grained models of the spin label that lower the resolution and explicit models that lead to resource-intense simulations. These methods are further limited by their reliance on distance distributions, which are calculated from a primary refocused echo decay signal and contain uncertainties that may require manual refinement. Here, we addressed these challenges by developing RosettaDEER, a scoring method within the Rosetta software suite capable of simulating double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy decay traces and distance distributions between spin labels fast enough to fold proteins de novo. We demonstrate that the accuracy of resulting distance distributions match or exceed those generated by more computationally intensive methods. Moreover, decay traces generated from these distributions recapitulate intermolecular background coupling parameters even when the time window of data collection is truncated. As a result, RosettaDEER can discriminate between poorly folded and native-like models by using decay traces that cannot be accurately converted into distance distributions using regularized fitting approaches. Finally, using two challenging test cases, we demonstrate that RosettaDEER leverages these experimental data for protein fold prediction more effectively than previous methods. These benchmarking results confirm that RosettaDEER can effectively leverage sparse experimental data for a wide array of modeling applications built into the Rosetta software suite.},

abstract = {A major transformation of the amount of biological information can be effected, which can be obtained from a set of experiments by direct incorporation of scientific constraints into the analysis of the data. The chapter has provided a âcookbookâ approach to develop (and using) nonlinear least-squares analysis programs. The term âscientific constraintsâ is meant to denote direct application (into the analysis program) of the mathematical constraints imposed on the data through experimental design and accessory information. When first approaching a data analysis problem, what general class of computer algorithms should be applied to the data needs to be determined. The relationship between experimental observables and biological information in almost all of biochemistry and biophysics is nonlinear. Therefore, the best methodology to fit a nonlinear model to experimental data needs to be determined. The role of the classic biochemical data transformations should be exclusively for graphical representation of the data. All of the data analysis should be performed in a nonlinear fashion on the actual (raw) data. The nonlinear data analysis requirements of different laboratories in the field of biochemistry and biophysics vary greatly. For the laboratory, which occasionally needs to fit small numbers of data (say 10â500 data points) to a model, data can be easily described analytically (for example, sums of exponentials, simple binding isotherms); prepackaged nonlinear data analysis programs will probably be sufficient. {\textcopyright} 1992, Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {For a representative set of 64 nonhomologous proteins, each containing a structure solved by NMR and X-ray crystallography, we analyzed the variations in atomic coordinates between NMR models, the temperature (B) factors measured by X-ray crystallography, and the fluctuation dynamics predicted by the Gaussian network model (GNM). The NMR and X-ray data exhibited a correlation of 0.49. The GNM results, on the other hand, yielded a correlation of 0.59 with X-ray data and a distinctively better correlation (0.75) with NMR data. The higher correlation between GNM and NMR data, compared to that between GNM and X-ray B factors, is shown to arise from the differences in the spectrum of modes accessible in solution and in the crystal environment. Mainly, large-amplitude motions sampled in solution are restricted, if not inaccessible, in the crystalline environment of X-rays. Combined GNM and NMR analysis emerges as a useful tool for assessing protein dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The relationship between DNA sequence recognition and catalytic specificity in a DNA-modifying enzyme was explored using paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions as probes for ESR spectroscopic and biochemical studies. Electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy establishes that Cu 2+ coordinates to histidine residues in the EcoRI endonuclease homodimer bound to its specific DNA recognition site. The coordinated His residues were identified by a unique use of Cu 2+-ion based long-range distance constraints. Double electron- electron resonance data yield Cu 2+-Cu 2+ and Cu 2+-nitroxide distances that are uniquely consistent with one Cu 2+ bound to His114 in each subunit. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirms that two Cu 2+ ions bind per complex. Unexpectedly, Mg 2+-catalyzed DNA cleavage by EcoRI is profoundly inhibited by Cu 2+ binding at these hitherto unknown sites, 13 {\AA} away from the Mg 2+positions in the catalytic centers. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a model for inhibition of catalysis, whereby the Cu 2+ ions alter critical protein-DNA interactions and water molecule positions in the catalytic sites. In the absence of Cu 2+, the Mg 2+-dependence of EcoRI catalysis shows positive cooperativity, which would enhance EcoRI inactivation of foreign DNA by irreparable doublestrand cuts, in preference to readily repaired single-strand nicks. Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations suggest that this cooperativity arises because the binding of Mg 2+ in one catalytic site makes the surface electrostatic potential in the distal catalytic site more negative, thus enhancing binding of the second Mg 2+. Taken together, our results shed light on the structural and electrostatic factors that affect site-specific catalysis by this class of endonucleases.},

abstract = {Lipoxygenase enzymes initiate diverse signaling pathways by specifically directing oxygen to different carbons of arachidonate and other polyunsaturated acyl chains, but structural origins of this specificity have remained unclear. We therefore determined the nature of the lipoxygenase interaction with the polar-end of a paramagnetic lipid by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Distances between selected grid points on soybean seed lipoxygenase-1 (SBL1) and a lysolecithin spin-labeled on choline were measured by pulsed (electron) dipolar spectroscopy. The protein grid was designed by structure-based modeling so that five natural side chains were replaced with spin labels. Pairwise distances in 10 doubly spin-labeled mutants were examined by pulsed dipolar spectroscopy, and a fit to the model was optimized. Finally, experimental distances between the lysolecithin spin and each single spin site on SBL1 were also obtained. With these 15 distances, distance geometry localized the polar-end and the spin of the lysolecithin to the region between the two domains in the SBL1 structure, nearest to E236, K260, Q264, and Q544. Mutation of a nearby residue, E256A, relieved the high pH requirement for enzyme activity of SBL1 and allowed lipid binding at pH 7.2.

The most relevant conformations to cellular protein folding are the ones populated under physiological conditions. To avoid the problem of low expression that is seen with unstable variants, we used methionine oxidation to destabilize monomeric lambda repressor and predominantly populate the denatured state under nondenaturing buffer conditions. The denatured ensemble populated under these conditions comprises conformations that are compact. Analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments indicate a small increase in Stokes radius over that of the native state. A significant degree of alpha-helical structure in these conformations is detected by far-UV circular dichroism, and some tertiary interactions are suggested by near-UV circular dichroism. The characteristics of the denatured state populated by methionine oxidation in nondenaturing buffer are very different from those found in chemical denaturant.},

NMR was used to characterize the secondary structure and dynamics of MetO-$\lambda$LS in standard phosphate buffer. 13C$\alpha$ and 1H$\alpha$ chemical shift indices reveal a region of significant helicity between residues 9 and 29. This helical content is further supported by the observation of medium-range amide NOEs. The remaining residues do not exhibit significant helicity as determined by NMR. We determined 15N relaxation parameters for 64 of 85 residues at 600 and 800 MHz. There are two distinct regions of reduced flexibility, residues 8-32 in the N-terminal third and residues 50-83 in the C-terminal third. The middle third, residues 33-50, has greater flexibility. We have analyzed the amplitude of the backbone motions in terms of the physical properties of the amino acids and conclude that conformational restriction of the backbone MetO-$\lambda$LS is due to nascent helix formation in the region corresponding to native helix 1. The bulkiness of amino acid residues in the C-terminal third leads to the potential for hydrophobic interactions, which is suggested by chemical exchange detected by the difference in spectral density J(0) at the two static magnetic fields. The more flexible middle region is the result of a predominance of small side chains in this region. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Unfortunately, the correlations between different motional modes are poorly captured by discrete ensemble representations. Here, we present new ways to both represent and visualize correlated interdomain motions. Interdomain motions are determined directly from residual dipolar couplings, represented as a continuous conformational distribution, and visualized using the disk-on-sphere representation. Using the disk-on-sphere representation, features of interdomain motions, including correlations, are intuitively visualized. The representation works especially well for multidomain systems with broad conformational distributions.This analysis also can be extended to multiple probability density modes, using a Bingham mixture model. We use this new paradigm to study the interdomain motions of staphylococcal protein A, which is a key virulence factor contributing to the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus. We capture the smooth transitions between important states and demonstrate the utility of continuous distribution functions for computing the reorientational components of binding thermodynamics.

abstract = {The topology of most experimentally determined protein domains is defined by the relative arrangement of secondary structure elements, i.e. $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-strands, which make up 50-70% of the sequence. Pairing of $\beta$-strands defines the topology of $\beta$-sheets. The packing of side chains between $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets defines the majority of the protein core. Often, limited experimental datasets restrain the position of secondary structure elements while lacking detail with respect to loop or side chain conformation. At the same time the regular structure and reduced flexibility of secondary structure elements make these interactions more predictable when compared to flexible loops and side chains. To determine the topology of the protein in such settings, we introduce a tailored knowledge-based energy function that evaluates arrangement of secondary structure elements only. Based on the amino acid C $\beta$ atom coordinates within secondary structure elements, potentials for amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, secondary structure element packing, $\beta$-strand pairing, loop length, radius of gyration, contact order and secondary structure prediction agreement are defined. Separate penalty functions exclude conformations with clashes between amino acids or secondary structure elements and loops that cannot be closed. Each individual term discriminates for native-like protein structures. The composite potential significantly enriches for native-like models in three different databases of 10,000-12,000 protein models in 80-94% of the cases.

abstract = {Prediction of transmembrane spans and secondary structure from the protein sequence is generally the first step in the structural characterization of (membrane) proteins. Preference of a stretch of amino acids in a protein to form secondary structure and being placed in the membrane are correlated. Nevertheless, current methods predict either secondary structure or individual transmembrane states. We introduce a method that simultaneously predicts the secondary structure and transmembrane spans from the protein sequence. This approach not only eliminates the necessity to create a consensus prediction from possibly contradicting outputs of several predictors but bears the potential to predict conformational switches, i.e., sequence regions that have a high probability to change for example from a coil conformation in solution to an $\alpha$-helical transmembrane state. An artificial neural network was trained on databases of 177 membrane proteins and 6048 soluble proteins. The output is a 3 Ã 3 dimensional probability matrix for each residue in the sequence that combines three secondary structure types (helix, strand, coil) and three environment types (membrane core, interface, solution). The prediction accuracies are 70.3% for nine possible states, 73.2% for three-state secondary structure prediction, and 94.8% for three-state transmembrane span prediction. These accuracies are comparable to state-of-the-art predictors of secondary structure (e.g., Psipred) or transmembrane placement (e.g., OCTOPUS).

abstract = {A two-stage neural network has been used to predict protein secondary structure based on the position specific scoring matrices generated by PSI-BLAST. Despite the simplicity and convenience of the approach used, the results are found to be superior to those produced by other methods, including the popular PHD method according to our own benchmarking results and the results from the recent Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction experiment (CASP3), where the method was evaluated by stringent blind testing. Using a new testing set based on a set of 187 unique folds, and three-way cross-validation based on structural similarity criteria rather than sequence similarity criteria used previously (no similar folds were present in both the testing and training sets) the method presented here (PSIPRED) achieved an average Q3 score of between 76.5% to 78.3% depending on the precise definition of observed secondary structure used, which is the highest published score for any method to date. Given the success of the method in CASP3, it is reasonable to be confident that the evaluation presented here gives a fair indication of the performance of the method in general.},

abstract = {We describe a method for predicting the conformations of loops in proteins and its application to four of the complementarity determining regions [CDRs] in the crystallographically determined structure of MCPC603. The method is based on the generation of a large number of randomly generated conformations for the backbone of the loop being studied, followed by either minimization or molecular dynamics followed by minimization starting from these random structures. The details of the algorithm for the generation of the loops are presented in the first paper in this series (Shenkin etal.[submitted]). The results of minimization and molecular dynamics applied to these loops is presented here. For the two shortest CDRs studied (H1 and L2, which are five and seven amino acids long), minimizations and dynamics simulations which ignore interactions of the loop amino acids beyond the carbon ture closely. This suggests that these loops fold independently of sequence variation. For the third CDR (L3, which is nine amino acids), those portions of the CDR near its base which are hydrogen bonded to framework are well replicated by our procedures, but the top of the loop shows singificant conformational variability. This variability persists when side chain interactions for the MCPC603 sequence are included. For a fourth CDR (H3, which is 11 amino acids long), new lowâenergy backbone conformations are found; however, only those which are close to the crystal are compatible with the sequence when side chain interactions are taken into account. Results from minimuzation and dynamics on single CDRs with all other CDRs removed are presented. These allow us to explore the extent to which individual CDR conformations are determined by interactions with framework only. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1986 Alan R. Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {One approach to finding the conformation of minimum energy for a complicated molecule is to perform energy minimization, perhaps coupled to more exhaustive search procedures such as dynamics or Monte Carlo sampling, from many starting conformation. Where there are geometric constraints on the conformations, as in a ring molecule, or a variable loop starting and ending in known constant regions of one of a series of homologous proteins, rapidly generating many such starting conformations, all satisfying the constraints, has been a problem in the past. We have devised an algorithm, which we call random tweak, which performs this task in the context of a torsional description of a molecule, and have used it to model the backbones of the six CDRs (complementarity determining regions) of the immunoglobulin MCPC603. These range in size from 5 to 19 residues, and have from 8 to 36 variable dihedral angles. Ensembles of 100 properly closed backbone structures for each CDR were generated under several conditions of van der Waals screening internally and against the rest of the molecule, and ensembles of 1000 were generated for selected CDRs. These structure âlibrariesâ reveal how the geometry at the base of a CDR and the topography of the surrounding protein surface restrict the region of space that a given CDR can occupy. In accord with simple notions of chain molecule statistics, the more highly extended a CDR at its base, the more similar the possible structures and the fewer that are necessary to span the conformational space. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics studies (reported elsewhere) using these libraries to furnish starting conformations show that, as the number of residues in a CDR goes from five to nine, the number of randomly generated structures necessary to ensure that lowâlying energetic minima, such as the native conformation, will be found several times goes from a few tens to a few hundred. Some of the spatial features of an ensemble of random conformations are implicit in the histogram of the rms atomic displacements calculated for all the pairs in the ensemble. The random tweak method is carried out by setting each dihederal angle on the main chain of the variable fragment to a random value, then using an iterated linearized Lagrange multiplier technique to enforce the geometric constraints with the minimal conformational perturbation. The time required for the algorithm is linear in fragment length, and the resulting ability of the method to handle large loops makes it especially applicable to the modeling of homologous proteins. In most cases, hundreds of acceptable structures could be generated in a few hours on a VAX 11/780. Where van der Waals screening against fixed atoms need not be performed, as for isolated ring molecules, generation times go down by an order of magnitude or more.

PISCES can provide lists culled from the entire PDB or from lists of PDB entries or chains provided by the user. The sequence identities are obtained from PSI-BLAST alignments with position-specific substitution matrices derived from the non-redundant protein sequence database. PISCES therefore provides better lists than servers that use BLAST, which is unable to identify many relationships below 40% sequence identity and often overestimates sequence identity by aligning only well-conserved fragments. PDB sequences are updated weekly. PISCES can also cull non-PDB sequences provided by the user as a list of GenBank identifiers, a FASTA format file, or BLAST/PSI-BLAST output.},

Our goal in culling the PDB is to provide the longest list possible of the highest resolution structures that fulfill the sequence identity and structural quality cut-offs. The new PISCES server uses a combination of PSI-BLAST and structure-based alignments to determine sequence identities. Structure alignment produces more complete alignments and therefore more accurate sequence identities than PSI-BLAST. PISCES now allows a user to cull the PDB by-entry in addition to the standard culling by individual chains. In this scenario, a list will contain only entries that do not have a chain that has a sequence identity to any chain in any other entry in the list over the sequence identity cut-off. PISCES also provides fully annotated sequences including gene name and species. The server allows a user to cull an input list of entries or chains, so that other criteria, such as function, can be used. Results from a search on the re-engineered RCSB's site for the PDB can be entered into the PISCES server by a single click, combining the powerful searching abilities of the PDB with PISCES's utilities for sequence culling.

The community-wide Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment provides a double-blind study to evaluate improvements in protein structure prediction algorithms. We developed a protein structure prediction pipeline employing a three-stage approach, consisting of low-resolution topology search, high-resolution refinement, and molecular dynamics simulation to predict the tertiary structure of proteins from the primary structure alone or including distance restraints either from predicted residue-residue contacts, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) experiments, or mass spectroscopy (MS) cross-linking (XL) data. The protein structure prediction pipeline was evaluated in the CASP11 experiment on twenty regular protein targets as well as thirtythree 'assisted' protein targets, which also had distance restraints available. Although the low-resolution topology search module was able to sample models with a global distance test total score (GDT-TS) value greater than 30% for twelve out of twenty proteins, frequently it was not possible to select the most accurate models for refinement, resulting in a general decay of model quality over the course of the prediction pipeline. In this study, we provide a detailed overall analysis, study one target protein in more detail as it travels through the protein structure prediction pipeline, and evaluate the impact of limited experimental data.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality.

abstract = {The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the uptake of lactose in an exchange reaction with intracellularly formed galactose. The interactions between the substrate and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS have been characterized by assaying binding and transport of a range of sugars in proteoliposomes, in which the purified protein was reconstituted with a unidirectional orientation. Specificity for galactoside binding is given by the spatial configuration of the C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the galactose moiety. Except for a C-4 methoxy substitution, replacement of the hydroxyl groups for bulkier groups is not tolerated at these positions. Large hydrophobic or hydrophilic substitutions on the galactose C-1 $\alpha$ or $\beta$ position did not impair transport. In fact, the hydrophobic groups increased the binding affinity but decreased transport rates compared with galactose. Binding and transport characteristics of deoxygalactosides from either side of the membrane showed that the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site interact differently with galactose. Compared with galactose, the IC50 values for 2- deoxy- and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site were increased 150- and 20-fold, respectively, whereas they were the same at the extracellular binding site. From these and other experiments, we conclude that the binding sites and translocation pathway of LacS are spacious along the C-1 to C-4 axis of the galactose moiety and are restricted along the C-2 to C-6 axis. The differences in affinity at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site ensure that the transport via LacS is highly asymmetrical for the two opposing directions of translocation.},

abstract = {Protein structure alignment methods are used for the detection of evolutionary and functionally related positions in proteins. A wide array of different methods are available, but the choice of the best method is often not apparent to the user. Several studies have assessed the alignment accuracy and consistency of structure alignment methods, but none of these explicitly considered membrane proteins, which are important targets for drug development and have distinct structural features. Here, we compared 13 widely used pairwise structural alignment methods on a test set of homologous membrane protein structures (called HOMEP3). Each pair of structures was aligned and the corresponding sequence alignment was used to construct homology models. The model accuracy compared to the known structures was assessed using scoring functions not incorporated in the tested structural alignment methods. The analysis shows that fragment-based approaches such as FR-TM-align are the most useful for aligning structures of membrane proteins. Moreover, fragment-based approaches are more suitable for comparison of protein structures that have undergone large conformational changes. Nevertheless, no method was clearly superior to all other methods. Additionally, all methods lack a measure to rate the reliability of a position within a structure alignment. To solve both of these problems, we propose a consensus-type approach, combining alignments from four different methods, namely FR-TM-align, DaliLite, MATT, and FATCAT. Agreement between the methods is used to assign confidence values to each position of the alignment. Overall, we conclude that there remains scope for the improvement of structural alignment methods for membrane proteins.},

abstract = {The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was amplified to levels as high as 8 and 30% of total membrane protein in Escherichia coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In both organisms the protein was functional and the expression levels were highest with the streptococcal lacS promoter. Also a LacS deletion mutant, lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, could be amplified to levels >20% of membrane protein. Membranes from S. thermophilus proved to be superior in terms of efficient solubilization and ease and extent of purification of LacS; >95% of LacS was solubilized with relatively low concentrations of Triton X-100, n-octyl-$\beta$-D-glucoside, n-dodecyl-$\beta$-D-maltoside, or C12E8. The LacS protein carrying a poly-histidine tag was purified in large quantities ($\sim$5 mg/liter of culture) and with a purity >98% in a two-step process involving nickel chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The membrane reconstitution of LacS was studied systematically by stepwise solubilization of preformed liposomes, prepared from E. coli phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, and protein incorporation at the different stages of liposome solubilization. The detergents were removed by adsorption onto polystyrene beads and H+-lactose symport and lactose counterflow were measured. Highest transport activities were obtained when Triton X-100 was used throughout the solubilization/purification procedure, whereas activity was lost irreversibly with n-octyl-$\beta$-D-glucoside. For reconstitutions mediated by n-dodecyl-$\beta$-D-maltoside, C12E8, and to a lesser extent Triton X-100, the highest transport activities were obtained when the liposomes were titrated with low amounts of detergent (onset of liposome solubilization). Importantly, under these conditions proteoliposomes were obtained in which LacS was reconstituted in an inside-out orientation, as suggested by the outside labeling of a single cysteine mutant with a membrane impermeable biotin-maleimide. The results are consistent with a mechanism of reconstitution in which the hydrophilic regions of LacS prevent a random insertion of the protein into the membrane. Consistent with the in vivo lactose/galactose exchange catalyzed by the LacS protein, the maximal rate of lactose counterflow was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of H+- lactose symport.},

In Step 1, using an algorithm, we developed, the conformational space of membrane protein folds matching a set of distance constraints is explored to provide initial structures for local conformational searches. In Step 2, these structures refined against a custom penalty function that incorporates both measures derived from statistical analysis of solved membrane protein structures and distance constraints obtained from experiments. We begin by describing the statistical analysis of the solved membrane protein structures from which the theoretical portion of the penalty function was derived. We then describe the penalty function, and, using a set of six test cases, demonstrate that it is capable of distinguishing helical bundles that are close to the native bundle from those that are far from the native bundle. Finally, using a set of only 27 distance constraints extracted from the literature, we show that our method successfully recovers the structure of dark-adapted rhodopsin to within 3.2 A of the crystal structure.},

abstract = {ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the exporter class harness the energy of ATP hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to power the energetically uphill efflux of substrates by a dedicated transmembrane domain (TMD). Although numerous investigations have described the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and defined the architecture of ABC exporters, a detailed structural dynamic understanding of the transduction of ATP energy to the work of substrate translocation remains elusive. Here we used double electron-electron resonance and molecular dynamics simulations to describe the ATP- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of the mouse ABC efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp; also known as ABCB1), which has a central role in the clearance of xenobiotics and in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Pairs of spin labels were introduced at residues selected to track the putative inward-facing to outward-facing transition. Our findings illuminate how ATP energy is harnessed in the NBDs in a two-stroke cycle and elucidate the consequent conformational motion that reconfigures the TMD, two critical aspects of Pgp transport mechanism. Along with a fully atomistic model of the outward-facing conformation in membranes, the insight into Pgp conformational dynamics harmonizes mechanistic and structural data into a novel perspective on ATP-coupled transport and reveals mechanistic divergence within the efflux class of ABC transporters.},

abstract = {Evaluating protein structures requires reliable free energies with good estimates of both potential energies and entropies. Although there are many demonstrated successes from using knowledge-based potential energies, computing entropies of proteins has lagged far behind. Here we take an entirely different approach and evaluate knowledge-based conformational entropies of proteins based on the observed frequencies of contact changes between amino acids in a set of 167 diverse proteins, each of which has two alternative structures. The results show that charged and polar interactions break more often than hydrophobic pairs. This pattern correlates strongly with the average solvent exposure of amino acids in globular proteins, as well as with polarity indices and the sizes of the amino acids. Knowledgebased entropies are derived by using the inverse Boltzmann relationship, in a manner analogous to the way that knowledge-based potentials have been extracted. Including these new knowledge-based entropies almost doubles the performance of knowledge-based potentials in selecting the native protein structures from decoy sets. Beyond the overall energy-entropy compensation, a similar compensation is seen for individual pairs of interacting amino acids. The entropies in this report have immediate applications for 3D structure prediction, protein model assessment, and protein engineering and design.},

Here we present two efficient numerical methods to solve the computationally challenging maximum-entropy problem arising from a Bayesian formulation of ensemble refinement.

In two complementary formulations that differ in their dimensionality, we optimize either the log-weights directly or the generalized forces appearing in the explicit analytical form of the solution. We first demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the two methods using synthetic data. We then use NMR J-couplings to reweight an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation ensemble of the disordered peptide Ala-5 simulated with the AMBER99SBâ-ildn-q force field. After reweighting, we find a consistent increase in the population of the polyproline-II conformations and a decrease of $\alpha$-helical-like conformations.

High-resolution structure determination using experimental methods that yield distributional data remains extremely difficult, especially when the underlying conformational ensembles are quite heterogeneous. We have therefore developed a method to integrate sparse, multimultimodal spectroscopic data to obtain high-resolution estimates of conformational ensembles. We have tested our method by incorporating double electron-electron resonance data on the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) protein syntaxin-1a into biased molecular dynamics simulations. We find that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in capturing syntaxin's open-closed conformational equilibrium and further yields new conformational states that are consistent with experimental data and may help in understanding syntaxin's function.

A molecular simulations- and information-theory based approach to select which experiments best refine conformational ensembles has been developed. This approach was tested on three flexible proteins. For proteins where a clear mechanistic hypothesis exists, experiments that test this hypothesis were systematically identified. When available data did not yield such mechanistic hypotheses, experiments that significantly outperform structure-guided approaches in conformational refinement were identified.

abstract = {This paper is a continuation of the method introduced by Srivastava and Freed (2017) that is a new method based on truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) for obtaining physical results from experimental signals without any need for Tikhonov regularization or other similar methods that require a regularization parameter. We show here how to estimate the uncertainty in the SVD-generated solutions. The uncertainty in the solution may be obtained by finding the minimum and maximum values over which the solution remains converged. These are obtained from the optimum range of singular value contributions, where the width of this region depends on the solution point location (e.g., distance) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal. The uncertainty levels typically found are very small with substantial SNR of the (denoised) signal, emphasizing the reliability of the method. With poorer SNR, the method is still satisfactory but with greater uncertainty, as expected. Pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy experiments are used as an example, but this TSVD approach is general and thus applicable to any similar experimental method wherein singular matrix inversion is needed to obtain the physically relevant result. We show that the Srivastava-Freed TSVD method along with the estimate of uncertainty can be effectively applied to pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance signals with SNR > 30, and even for a weak signal (e.g., SNR â 3) reliable results are obtained by this method, provided the signal is first denoised using wavelet transforms (WavPDS).},

MATE transporters confer multidrug resistance to bacterial pathogens and cancer cells, thus causing critical reductions in the therapeutic efficacies of antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, respectively. Therefore, the development of MATE inhibitors has long been awaited in the field of clinical medicine. Here we present the crystal structures of the H+-driven MATE transporter from Pyrococcus furiosus in two distinct apo-form conformations, and in complexes with a derivative of the antibacterial drug norfloxacin and three in vitro selected thioether-macrocyclic peptides, at 2.1-3.0 {\AA} resolutions. The structures, combined with functional analyses, show that the protonation of Asp 41 on the amino (N)-terminal lobe induces the bending of TM1, which in turn collapses the N-lobe cavity, thereby extruding the substrate drug to the extracellular space. Moreover, the macrocyclic peptides bind the central cleft in distinct manners, which correlate with their inhibitory activities. The strongest inhibitory peptide that occupies the N-lobe cavity may pave the way towards the development of efficient inhibitors against MATE transporters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we present the crystal structure of a MATE transporter from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfMATE) in the long-sought-after inward-facing state, which was obtained after crystallization in the presence of native lipids. Transition from the outward-facing state to the inward-facing state involves rigid body movements of transmembrane helices (TMs) 2â6 and 8â12 to form an inverted V, facilitated by a loose binding of TM1 and TM7 to their respective bundles and their conformational flexibility. The inward-facing structure of PfMATE in combination with the outward-facing one supports an alternating access mechanism for the MATE family transporters.},

The current mechanistic understanding of ion-coupled substrate transport has been informed by a limited set of MATE transporter crystal structures from multiple organisms that capture a 12-transmembrane helix topology adopting similar outward-facing conformations. Although these structures mapped conserved residues important for function, the mechanistic role of these residues in shaping the conformational cycle has not been investigated. Here, we use double-electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to explore ligand-dependent conformational changes of NorM from Vibrio cholerae (NorM-Vc), a MATE transporter proposed to be coupled to both Na+ and H+ gradients. Distance measurements between spin labels on the periplasmic side of NorM-Vc identified unique structural intermediates induced by binding of Na+, H+, or the substrate doxorubicin. The Na+- and H+-dependent intermediates were associated with distinct conformations of TM1. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues revealed that Na+- and H+-driven conformational changes are facilitated by a network of polar residues in the N-terminal domain cavity, whereas conserved carboxylates buried in the C-terminal domain are critical for stabilizing the drug-bound state. Interpreted in conjunction with doxorubicin binding of mutant NorM-Vc and cell toxicity assays, these results establish the role of ion-coupled conformational dynamics in the functional cycle and implicate H+ in the doxorubicin release mechanism.},

Although divergent transport mechanisms have been proposed for these transporters, previous structural and functional analyses of members of the MATE subfamily DinF suggest that the N-terminal domain (NTD) supports substrate and ion binding. In this report, we investigated the relationship of ligand binding within the NTD to the drug resistance mechanism of theH+-dependent MATE from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfMATE).Tofacilitate this study, we developed a cell growth assay in Escherichia coli to characterize the resistance conferred by PfMATE to toxic concentrations of the antimicrobial compound rhodamine 6G. Expression of WT PfMATE promoted cell growth in the presence of drug, but amino acid substitutions of conserved NTD residues compromised drug resistance. Steady-state binding analysis with purified PfMATE indicated that substrate affinity was unperturbed in these NTD variants. However, exploiting Trp fluorescence as an intrinsic reporter of conformational changes, we found that these variants impaired formation of a unique H+-stabilized structural intermediate. These results imply that disruption of H+ coupling is the origin of compromised toxin resistance in PfMATE variants. These findings support a model mechanism wherein the NTD mediates allosteric coupling to ion gradients through conformational changes to drive substrate transport in PfMATE. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for diverging transport mechanisms within a prokaryotic MATE subfamily.},

abstract = {Determination of side-chain conformations is an important step in protein structure prediction and protein design. Many such methods have been presented, although only a small number are in widespread use. SCWRL is one such method, and the SCWRL3 program (2003) has remained popular because of its speed, accuracy, and ease-of-use for the purpose of homology modeling. However, higher accuracy at comparable speed is desirable. This has been achieved in a new program SCWRL4 through: (1) a new backbone-dependent rotamer library based on kernel density estimates; (2) averaging over samples of conformations about the positions in the rotamer library; (3) a fast anisotropic hydrogen bonding function; (4) a short-range, soft van der Waals atom-atom interaction potential; (5) fast collision detection using k-discrete oriented polytopes; (6) a tree decomposition algorithm to solve the combinatorial problem; and (7) optimization of all parameters by determining the interaction graph within the crystal environment using symmetry operators of the crystallographic space group. Accuracies as a function of electron density of the side chains demonstrate that side chains with higher electron density are easier to predict than those with low-electron density and presumed conformational disorder. For a testing set of 379 proteins, 86% of $\chi$ 1 angles and 75% of $\chi$ 1+2 angles are predicted correctly within 408 of the X-ray positions. Among side chains with higher electron density (25-100th percentile), these numbers rise to 89 and 80%. The new program maintains its simple command-line interface, designed for homology modeling, and is now available as a dynamic-linked library for incorporation into other software programs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Evaluating protein structures requires reliable free energies with good estimates of both potential energies and entropies. Although there are many demonstrated successes from using knowledge-based potential energies, computing entropies of proteins has lagged far behind. Here we take an entirely different approach and evaluate knowledge-based conformational entropies of proteins based on the observed frequencies of contact changes between amino acids in a set of 167 diverse proteins, each of which has two alternative structures. The results show that charged and polar interactions break more often than hydrophobic pairs. This pattern correlates strongly with the average solvent exposure of amino acids in globular prot eins, as well as with polarity indices and the sizes of the amino acids. Knowledgebased entropies are derived by using the inverse Boltzmann relationship, in a manner analogous to the way that knowledge-based potentials have been extracted. Including these new knowledge-based entropies almost doubles the performance of knowledge-based potentials in selecting the native protein structures from decoy sets. Beyond the overall energy-entropy compensation, a similar compensation is seen for individual pairs of interacting amino acids. The entropies in this report have immediate applications for 3D structure prediction, protein model assessment, and protein engineering and design.},

LATs are asymmetric amino acid exchangers where the low apparent affinity cytoplasmic side controls the exchange of substrates with high apparent affinity on the extracellular side. Here, we report the crystal structures of an LAT, the bacterial alanine-serine-cysteine exchanger (BasC), in a non-occluded inward-facing conformation in both apo and substrate-bound states. We crystallized BasC in complex with a nanobody, which blocks the transporter from the intracellular side, thus unveiling the sidedness of the substrate interaction of BasC. Two conserved residues in human LATs, Tyr 236 and Lys 154, are located in equivalent positions to the Na1 and Na2 sites of sodium-dependent APC superfamily transporters.

The latter can also be used to optimise the alignment when the profile pre-processing strategies are iterated. In addition, we have modelled the server output to enable comprehensive visualisation of the generated alignment and easy figure generation for publications. The alignment is represented in five default colour schemes based on: residue type, position conservation, position reliability, residue hydrophobicity and secondary structure; depending on the options set. We have also implemented a custom colour scheme that allows the user to select which colour will represent one or more amino acids in the alignment. The grouping of sequences, on which the alignment is based, can also be visualised as a dendrogram.

abstract = {Enteropathogenic bacteria, exemplified by Escherichia coli, rely on acid-resistance systems (ARs) to survive the acidic environment of the stomach. AR3 consumes intracellular protons through decarboxylation of arginine (Arg) in the cytoplasm and exchange of the reaction product agmatine (Agm) with extracellular Arg. The latter process is mediated by the Arg:Agm antiporter AdiC, which is activated in response to acidic pH and remains fully active at pH 6.0 and below. Despite our knowledge of structural information, the molecular mechanism by which AdiC senses acidic pH remains completely unknown. Relying on alanine-scanning mutagenesis and an in vitro proteoliposome-based transport assay, we have identified Tyr74 as a critical pH sensor in AdiC. The AdiC variant Y74A exhibited robust transport activity at all pH values examined while maintaining stringent substrate specificity for Arg:Agm. Replacement of Tyr74 by Phe, but not by any other amino acid, led to the maintenance of pH-dependent substrate transport. These observations, in conjunction with structural information, identify a working model for pH-induced activation of AdiC in which a closed conformation is disrupted by cation-$\pi$ interactions between proton and the aromatic side chain of Tyr74.},

Hence, the DEER data alone do not provide high-resolution structural information. To disentangle this variability, we introduce a minimally biased simulation method to sample a structural ensemble that reproduces multiple experimental signals within the uncertainty. In contrast to previous approaches, our method targets the raw data themselves, and thereby it brings forth an unbiased molecular interpretation of the experiments. After validation on the T4 lysozyme, we apply this technique to interpret recent DEER experiments on a membrane transporter binding protein (VcSiaP). The results highlight the large-scale conformational movement that occurs upon substrate binding and reveal that the unbound VcSiaP is more open in solution than the X-ray structure.},

Compared to angiotensin II, the endogenous agonist, agonists with enhanced Gq coupling more strongly stabilize an âopenâ conformation with an accessible transducer-binding site. $\beta$-arrestin-biased agonists deficient in Gq coupling do not stabilize this open conformation but instead favor two more occluded conformations.

Many of the experiments characterize a static ensemble obtained by shock-freezing. Compared with characterizing the dynamic ensemble at ambient temperature, analysis is simplified and information loss due to overlapping timescales of measurement and system dynamics is avoided. The necessity for labelling leads to sparse restraint sets that require integration with data from other methodologies for building models.

Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank. These results suggest that the combination of high-resolution structure prediction with state-of-the-art phasing tools may be unexpectedly powerful in phasing crystallographic data for which molecular replacement is hindered by the absence of sufficiently accurate previous models. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

(iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailedmodels have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days.

Activation of phospholipase activity is induced by protein-protein interactions with ubiquitin in the cytosol of a targeted eukaryotic cell, leading to destruction of host cell membranes. Previous work in our laboratory suggested that conformational changes within a C-terminal domain of the toxin might be involved in the activation mechanism. In this study, we use site-directed spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate conformational changes in a C-terminal four-helical bundle region of ExoU as it interacts with lipid substrates and ubiquitin, and to examine the localization of this domain with respect to the lipid bilayer. In the absence of ubiquitin or substrate liposomes, the overall structure of the C-terminal domain is in good agreement with crystallographic models derived from ExoU in complex with its chaperone, SpcU. Significant conformational changes are observed throughout the domain in the presence of ubiquitin and liposomes combined that are not observed with either liposomes or ubiquitin alone. In the presence of ubiquitin, two interhelical loops of the C-terminal four-helix bundle appear to penetrate the membrane bilayer, stabilizing ExoU-membrane association. Thus, ubiquitin and the substrate lipid bilayer act synergistically to induce a conformational rearrangement in the C-terminal domain of ExoU.},

abstract = {Given its ability to measure multicomponent distance distributions between electron-spin probes, Double Electron-Electron Resonance spectroscopy (DEER) has become a leading technique to assess the structural dynamics of biomolecules. However, methodologies to evaluate the statistical error of these distributions are not standard, often hampering a rigorous interpretation of the experimental results. Distance distributions are often determined from the experimental DEER data through a mathematical method known as Tikhonov regularization, but this approach makes rigorous error estimates difficult. Here, we build upon an alternative model-based approach in which the distance probability distribution is represented as a sum of Gaussian components and use propagation of errors to calculate an associated confidence band. Our approach considers all sources of uncertainty, including the experimental noise, the uncertainty in the fitted background signal, and the limited time-span of the data collection. The resulting confidence band reveals the most and least reliable features of the probability distribution, thereby informing the structural interpretation of DEER experiments. To facilitate this interpretation, we also generalize the molecular-simulation method known as Ensemble-Biased Metadynamics. This method, originally designed to generate maximum-entropy structural ensembles consistent with one or more probability distributions, now also accounts for the uncertainty in those target distributions, exactly as dictated by their confidence bands. After careful benchmarks, we demonstrate the proposed techniques using DEER results from spin-labeled T4 lysozyme.},

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments probe nanometer-scale distances in spin-labeled proteins and nucleic acids. Rotamer libraries of the covalently attached spin-labels help reduce position uncertainties. Here we show that rotamer reweighting is essential for precision distance measurements, making it possible to resolve {\AA}ngstrom-scale domain motions. We analyze extensive DEER measurements on the three N-terminal polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains of the outer membrane protein Omp85. Using the "Bayesian inference of ensembles" maximum-entropy method, we extract rotamer weights from the DEER measurements. Small weight changes suffice to eliminate otherwise significant discrepancies between experiments and model and unmask 1-3 {\AA} domain motions relative to the crystal structure. Rotamer-weight refinement is a simple yet powerful tool for precision distance measurements that should be broadly applicable to label-based measurements including DEER, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).},

abstract = {The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus was amplified to levels as high as 8 and 30% of total membrane protein in Escherichia coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In both organisms the protein was functional and the expression levels were highest with the streptococcal lacS promoter. Also a LacS deletion mutant, lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, could be amplified to levels >20% of membrane protein. Membranes from S. thermophilus proved to be superior in terms of efficient solubilization and ease and extent of purification of LacS; >95% of LacS was solubilized with relatively low concentrations of Triton X-100, n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside, n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, or C12E8. The LacS protein carrying a poly-histidine tag was purified in large quantities (approximately 5 mg/liter of culture) and with a purity >98% in a two-step process involving nickel chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The membrane reconstitution of LacS was studied systematically by stepwise solubilization of preformed liposomes, prepared from E. coli phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, and protein incorporation at the different stages of liposome solubilization. The detergents were removed by adsorption onto polystyrene beads and H+-lactose symport and lactose counterflow were measured. Highest transport activities were obtained when Triton X-100 was used throughout the solubilization/purification procedure, whereas activity was lost irreversibly with n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside. For reconstitutions mediated by n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, C12E8, and to a lesser extent Triton X-100, the highest transport activities were obtained when the liposomes were titrated with low amounts of detergent (onset of liposome solubilization). Importantly, under these conditions proteoliposomes were obtained in which LacS was reconstituted in an inside-out orientation, as suggested by the outside labeling of a single cysteine mutant with a membrane impermeable biotin-maleimide. The results are consistent with a mechanism of reconstitution in which the hydrophilic regions of LacS prevent a random insertion of the protein into the membrane. Consistent with the in vivo lactose/galactose exchange catalyzed by the LacS protein, the maximal rate of lactose counterflow was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of H+-lactose symport.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins make up approximately one third of all proteins, and they play key roles in a plethora of physiological processes. However, membrane proteins make up less than 2% of experimentally determined structures, despite significant advances in structure determination methods, such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. One potential alternative means of structure elucidation is to combine computational methods with experimental EPR data. In 2011, Hirst and others introduced RosettaEPR and demonstrated that this approach could be successfully applied to fold soluble proteins. Furthermore, few computational methods for de novo folding of integral membrane proteins have been presented. In this work, we present RosettaTMH, a novel algorithm for structure prediction of helical membrane proteins. A benchmark set of 34 proteins, in which the proteins ranged in size from 91 to 565 residues, was used to compare RosettaTMH to Rosetta's two existing membrane protein folding protocols: the published RosettaMembrane folding protocol ("MembraneAbinitio") and folding from an extended chain ("ExtendedChain"). When EPR distance restraints are used, RosettaTMH+EPR outperforms ExtendedChain+EPR for 11 proteins, including the largest six proteins tested. RosettaTMH+EPR is capable of achieving native-like folds for 30 of 34 proteins tested, including receptors and transporters. For example, the average RMSD100SSE relative to the crystal structure for rhodopsin was 6.1 Â± 0.4 {\AA} and 6.5 Â± 0.6 {\AA} for the 449-residue nitric oxide reductase subunit B, where the standard deviation reflects variance in RMSD100SSE values across ten different EPR distance restraint sets. The addition of RosettaTMH and RosettaTMH+EPR to the Rosetta family of de novo folding methods broadens the scope of helical membrane proteins that can be accurately modeled with this software suite.},

Here we present the first crystal structure of SLC38A9 from Danio rerio in complex with arginine. As captured in the cytosol-open state, the bound arginine was locked in a transitional state stabilized by transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) of drSLC38A9, which was anchored at the groove between TM5 and TM7. These anchoring interactions were mediated by the highly conserved WNTMM motif in TM1, and mutations in this motif abolished arginine transport by drSLC38A9. The underlying mechanism of substrate binding is critical for sensitizing the mTORC1 signaling pathway to amino acids and for maintenance of lysosomal amino acid homeostasis. This study offers a first glimpse into a prototypical model for SLC38 transporters.},

In mammals, cellular arginine availability is determined by members of the solute carrier (SLC) 7 family of cationic amino acid transporters. Whereas CAT-1 functions to supply cationic amino acids for cellular metabolism, CAT-2A and-2B are required for macrophage activation and play important roles in regulating inflammation. Here, we present the crystal structure of a close homologue of the mammalian CAT transporters that reveals how these proteins specifically recognise arginine.

abstract = {EmrE is a small, homodimeric membrane transporter that exploits the established electrochemical proton gradient across the Escherichia coli inner membrane to export toxic polyaromatic cations, prototypical of the wider small-multidrug resistance transporter family. While prior studies have established many fundamental aspects of the specificity and rate of substrate transport in EmrE, low resolution of available structures has hampered identification of the transport coupling mechanism. Here we present a complete, refined atomic structure of EmrE optimized against available cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data to delineate the critical interactions by which EmrE regulates its conformation during the transport process. With the model, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations of the transporter in explicit membranes to probe EmrE dynamics under different substrate loading and conformational states, representing different intermediates in the transport cycle. The refined model is stable under extended simulation. The water dynamics in simulation indicate that the hydrogen-bonding networks around a pair of solvent-exposed glutamate residues (E14) depend on the loading state of EmrE. One specific hydrogen bond from a tyrosine (Y60) on one monomer to a glutamate (E14) on the opposite monomer is especially critical, as it locks the protein conformation when the glutamate is deprotonated. The hydrogen bond provided by Y60 lowers the pKa of one glutamate relative to the other, suggesting both glutamates should be protonated for the hydrogen bond to break and a substrate-free transition to take place. These findings establish the molecular mechanism for the coupling between proton transfer reactions and protein conformation in this proton-coupled secondary transporter.},

The structures are compatible with existing mutagenesis data as well as NMR and biochemical experiments, including pKas of the catalytic glutamate residues and the dissociation constant (KD) of the tetraphenylphosphonium+ cation. The refined structures show the arrangement of residue side chains in the EmrE active site occupied by two different ligands and in the absence of a ligand, illustrating how EmrE can adopt structurally diverse active site configurations. The structures also show a stable, well-packed binding interface between the helices H4 of the two monomers, which is believed to be crucial for EmrE dimerization. Guided by the atomic details of this interface, we design proteolysis-resistant stapled peptides that bind to helix H4 of an EmrE monomer. The peptides are expected to interfere with the dimerization and thereby inhibit drug transport. Optimal positions of the peptide staple were determined using free-energy simulations of peptide binding to monomeric EmrE. Three of the four top-scoring peptides selected for experimental testing resulted in significant inhibition of proton-driven ethidium efflux in live cells without nonspecific toxicity.

Here we describe a new approach to refining protein structure models that focuses sampling in regions most likely to contain errors while allowing the whole structure to relax in a physically realistic all-atom force field. In applications to models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data and to comparative models based on distant structural homologues, the method can significantly improve the accuracy of the structures in terms of both the backbone conformations and the placement of core side chains. Furthermore, the resulting models satisfy a particularly stringent test: they provide significantly better solutions to the X-ray crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement trials. Finally, we show that all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions that reach the high accuracy required for molecular replacement without any experimental phase information and in the absence of templates suitable for molecular replacement from the Protein Data Bank.

However, membrane proteins are typically longer than 200 aa and represent a formidable challenge for structure prediction. We have developed a method for predicting the structures of large membrane proteins by constraining helix-helix packing arrangements at particular positions predicted from sequence or identified by experiments. We tested the method on 12 membrane proteins of diverse topologies and functions with lengths ranging between 190 and 300 residues. Enforcing a single constraint during the folding simulations enriched the population of near-native models for 9 proteins. In 4 of the cases in which the constraint was predicted from the sequence, 1 of the 5 lowest energy models was superimposable within 4 A ring;on the native structure. Near-native structures could also be selected for heme-binding and pore-forming domains from simulations in which pairs of conserved histidine-chelating hemes and one experimentally determined salt bridge were constrained, respectively. These results suggest that models within 4 {\AA} of the native structure can be achieved for complex membrane proteins if even limited information on residue-residue interactions can be obtained from protein structure databases or experiments. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The analysis of evolutionary amino acid correlations has recently attracted a surge of renewed interest, also due to their successful use in De novo protein native structure prediction. However, many aspects of protein function, such as substrate binding and product release in enzymatic activity, can be fully understood only in terms of an equilibrium ensemble of alternative structures, rather than a single static structure. In this paper we combine coevolutionary data and molecular dynamics simulations to study protein conformational heterogeneity. To that end, we adapt the Boltzmann-learning algorithm to the analysis of homologous protein sequences and develop a coarse-grained protein model specifically tailored to convert the resulting contact predictions to a protein structural ensemble. By means of exhaustive sampling simulations, we analyze the set of conformations that are consistent with the observed residue correlations for a set of representative protein domains, showing that (i) the most representative structure is consistent with the experimental fold and (ii) the various regions of the sequence display different stability, related to multiple biologically relevant conformations and to the cooperativity of the coevolving pairs. Moreover, we show that the proposed protocol is able to reproduce the essential features of a protein folding mechanism as well as to account for regions involved in conformational transitions through the correct sampling of the involved conformers.},

abstract = {Experimental structure determination by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy is slow and time-consuming compared with the rate at which new protein sequences are being identified. NMR spectroscopy has the advantage of rapidly providing the structurally relevant information in the form of unassigned chemical shifts (CSs), intensities of NOESY crosspeaks [nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs)], and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), but use of these data are limited by the time and effort needed to assign individual resonances to specific atoms. Here, we develop a method for generating low-resolution protein structures by using unassigned NMR data that relies on the de novo protein structure prediction algorithm, ROSETTA [Simons, K.T., Kooperberg, C., Huang, E. & Baker, D. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 268, 209-225] and a Monte Carlo procedure that searches for the assignment of resonances to atoms that produces the best fit of the experimental NMR data to a candidate 3D structure. A large ensemble of models is generated from sequence information alone by using ROSETTA, an optimal assignment is identified for each model, and the models are then ranked based on their fit with the NMR data assuming the identified assignments. The method was tested on nine protein sequences between 56 and 140 amino acids and published CS, NOE, and RDC data. The procedure yielded models with rms deviations between 3 and 6 {\AA}, and, in four of the nine cases, the partial assignments obtained by the method could be used to refine the structures to high resolution (0.6-1.8 {\AA}) by repeated cycles of structure generation guided by the partial assignments, followed by reassignment using the newly generated models.},

abstract = {Few sequence alignment methods have been designed specifically for integral membrane proteins, even though these important proteins have distinct evolutionary and structural properties that might affect their alignments. Existing approaches typically consider membrane-related information either by using membrane-specific substitution matrices or by assigning distinct penalties for gap creation in transmembrane and non-transmembrane regions. Here, we ask whether favoring matching of predicted transmembrane segments within a standard dynamic programming algorithm can improve the accuracy of pairwise membrane protein sequence alignments. We tested various strategies using a specifically designed program called AlignMe. An updated set of homologous membrane protein structures, called HOMEP2, was used as a reference for optimizing the gap penalties. The best of the membrane-protein optimized approaches were then tested on an independent reference set of membrane protein sequence alignments from the BAliBASE collection. When secondary structure (S) matching was combined with evolutionary information (using a position-specific substitution matrix (P)), in an approach we called AlignMePS, the resultant pairwise alignments were typically among the most accurate over a broad range of sequence similarities when compared to available methods. Matching transmembrane predictions (T), in addition to evolutionary information, and secondary-structure predictions, in an approach called AlignMePST, generally reduces the accuracy of the alignments of closely-related proteins in the BAliBASE set relative to AlignMePS, but may be useful in cases of extremely distantly related proteins for which sequence information is less informative. The open source AlignMe code is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/alignme/, and at http://www.forrestlab.org, along with an online server and the HOMEP2 data set. {\textcopyright} 2013 Stamm et al.},

abstract = {Residue pairs that directly coevolve in protein families are generally close in protein 3D structures. Here we study the exceptions to this general trend - directly coevolving residue pairs that are distant in protein structures - to determine the origins of evolutionary pressure on spatially distant residues and to understand the sources of error in contact-based structure prediction. Over a set of 4,000 protein families, we find that 25% of directly coevolving residue pairs are separated by more than 5 {\AA} in protein structures and 3% by more than 15 {\AA}. The majority (91%) of directly coevolving residue pairs in the 5â15 {\AA} range are found to be in contact in at least one homologous structure - these exceptions arise from structural variation in the family in the region containing the residues. Thirty-five percent of the exceptions greater than 15 {\AA} are at homo-oligomeric interfaces, 19% arise from family structural variation, and 27% are in repeat proteins likely reflecting alignment errors. Of the remaining long-range exceptions (<1% of the total number of coupled pairs), many can be attributed to close interactions in an oligomeric state. Overall, the results suggest that directly coevolving residue pairs not in repeat proteins are spatially proximal in at least one biologically relevant protein conformation within the family; we find little evidence for direct coupling between residues at spatially separated allosteric and functional sites or for increased direct coupling between residue pairs on putative allosteric pathways connecting them.},

abstract = {Recent experimental studies of the denatured state and theoretical analyses of the folding landscape suggest that there are a large multiplicity of low-energy, partially folded conformations near the native state. In this report, we describe a strategy for predicting protein structure based on the working hypothesis that there are a greater number of low-energy conformations surrounding the correct fold than there are surrounding low- energy incorrect folds. To test this idea, 12 ensembles of 500 to 1,000 low- energy structures for 10 small proteins were analyzed by calculating the rms deviation of the C$\alpha$ coordinates between each conformation and every other conformation in the ensemble. In all 12 cases, the conformation with the greatest number of conformations within 4-{\AA} rms deviation was closer to the native structure than were the majority of conformations in the ensemble, and in most cases it was among the closest 1 to 5%. These results suggest that, to fold efficiently and retain robustness to changes in amino acid sequence, proteins may have evolved a native structure situated within a broad basin of low-energy conformations, a feature which could facilitate the prediction of protein structure at low resolution.},

abstract = {We introduce an enhanced-sampling method for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations referred to as ensemble-biased metadynamics (EBMetaD). The method biases a conventional MD simulation to sample a molecular ensemble that is consistent with one or more probability distributions known a priori, e.g., experimental intramolecular distance distributions obtained by double electron-electron resonance or other spectroscopic techniques. To this end, EBMetaD adds an adaptive biasing potential throughout the simulation that discourages sampling of configurations inconsistent with the target probability distributions. The bias introduced is the minimum necessary to fulfill the target distributions, i.e., EBMetaD satisfies the maximum-entropy principle. Unlike other methods, EBMetaD does not require multiple simulation replicas or the introduction of Lagrange multipliers, and is therefore computationally efficient and straightforward in practice. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the method for a model system as well as for spin-labeled T4 lysozyme in explicit water, and show how EBMetaD reproduces three double electron-electron resonance distance distributions concurrently within a few tens of nanoseconds of simulation time. EBMetaD is integrated in the open-source PLUMED plug-in (www.plumed-code.org), and can be therefore readily used with multiple MD engines.},

By identifying the common structural and dynamical features upon principal component analysis of a comprehensive ensemble of 90 experimentally resolved structures and anisotropic network model evaluation of collective motions, we provide a unified point of view for understanding the reasons why this particular fold has been selected by evolution to accomplish such a broad spectrum of functions. The parallel identification of conserved sequence features, localized at specific sites of transmembrane helices, sheds light on the role of broken helices (TM1 and TM6 in LeuT) in promoting ion/substrate binding and allosteric interconversion between the outward- and inward-facing conformations of transporters. Finally, the determination of the dynamics landscape for the structural ensemble provides a promising framework for the classification of transporters based on their dynamics, and the characterization of the collective movements that favour multimerization.

Recently, an inward-facing conformation of LeuT was solved revealing an unexpectedly large movement of transmembrane helix 1a (TM1a). We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the mutated and wild-type transporter, with and without the cocrystallized Fab antibody fragment, to investigate the properties of this inward-facing conformation in relation to transport by LeuT within the membrane environment. In all of the simulations, local conformational changes with respect to the crystal structure are consistently observed, especially in TM1a. Umbrella sampling revealed a soft potential for TM1a tilting. Furthermore, simulations of inward-facing LeuT with Na+ ions and substrate bound suggest that one of the Na+ ion binding sites is fully disrupted. Release of alanine and the second Na+ ion is also observed, giving insight into the final stage of the translocation process in atomistic detail.},

Many such organisms survive exposure to the harsh gastric environment (pH 1.5-4) by mounting extreme acid-resistance responses, one of which, the arginine-dependent system of Escherichia coli, has been studied at levels of cellular physiology, molecular genetics and protein biochemistry. This multiprotein system keeps the cytoplasm above pH 5 during acid challenge by continually pumping protons out of the cell using the free energy of arginine decarboxylation. At the heart of the process is a virtual proton pump in the inner membrane, called AdiC, that imports l-arginine from the gastric juice and exports its decarboxylation product agmatine. AdiC belongs to the APC superfamily of membrane proteins, which transports amino acids, polyamines and organic cations in a multitude of biological roles, including delivery of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis, facilitation of insulin release from pancreatic Î-cells, and, when inappropriately overexpressed, provisioning of certain fast-growing neoplastic cells with amino acids. High-resolution structures and detailed transport mechanisms of APC transporters are currently unknown. Here we describe a crystal structure of AdiC at 3.2 resolution. The protein is captured in an outward-open, substrate-free conformation with transmembrane architecture remarkably similar to that seen in four other families of apparently unrelated transport proteins. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Commensal and pathogenic enteric bacteria have developed several systems to adapt to proton leakage into the cytoplasm resulting from extreme acidic conditions. One such system involves arginine uptake followed by export of the decarboxylated product agmatine, carried out by the arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC), which thus works as a virtual proton pump. Here, using classical and targeted molecular dynamics, we investigated at the atomic level the mechanism of arginine transport through AdiC of E. coli. Overall, our MD simulation data clearly demonstrate that global rearrangements of several transmembrane segments are necessary but not sufficient for achieving transitions between structural states along the arginine translocation pathway. In particular, local structural changes, namely rotameric conversions of two aromatic residues, are needed to regulate access to both the outward- and inward-facing states. Our simulations have also enabled identification of a few residues, overwhelmingly aromatic, which are essential to guiding arginine in the course of its translocation. Most of them belong to gating elements whose coordinated motions contribute to the alternating access mechanism. Their conservation in all known E. coli acid resistance antiporters suggests that the transport mechanisms of these systems share common features. Last but not least, knowledge of the functional properties of AdiC can advance our understanding of the members of the amino acid-carbocation-polyamine superfamily, notably in eukaryotic cells.},

We have now identified a new metal-ion transporter in the rat, DGT1, which has an unusually broad substrate range that includes Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Pb2+. DCT1 mediates active transport that is proton-coupled and depends on the cell membrane potential. It is a 561-amino-acid protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains and is ubiquitously expressed, most notably in the proximal duodenum.

The effects on proliferation and tumor growth caused by exogenously overexpressed LAT1 were similarly analyzed. RESULTS: LAT1 was expressed in most human high-grade gliomas and glioma cell lines at various levels, with more ubiquitous expression of 4F2 heavy chain. Glioma cells with high LAT1 expression exhibited a marked increase in the uptake rate of L-[C]leucine. 2-Aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid treatment not only suppressed deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in association with the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 but also enhanced apoptosis with caspase activation, thereby exerting both cytostatic and cytocidal effects in glioma cells with high LAT1 expression levels. Furthermore, overexpression of LAT1 in glioma cells with low endogenous LAT1 expression significantly enhanced the rates of tumor cell growth in athymic mice. CONCLUSION: LAT1, the major transporter of system L, is frequently expressed at higher levels in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas and brain tissues, and it may play an important role in enhancing the rates of tumor cell proliferation and growth in vivo.

abstract = {The clinical significance of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) expression remains unclear, whereas many experimental studies have demonstrated that LAT1 is associated with the proliferation of cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of LAT1 in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 321 consecutive patients with completely resected pathologic stage I-III NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Expression of LAT1 and proliferative activity, as determined by the Ki-67 labelling index, was also evaluated immunohistochemically and correlated with the prognosis of patients who underwent complete resection of the tumour. Expression of LAT1 was positive in 163 patients (51%) (29% of adenocaricnoma (58 of 200 patients), 91% of squamous cell carcinoma (91 of 100 patients), and 67% of large cell carcinoma (14 of 21 patients)). The 5-year survival rate of LAT1-positive patients (51.8%) was significantly worse than that of LAT1-negative patients (87.8%; P<0.001). L-type amino acid transporter 1 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and disease stage. Multivariate analysis confirmed that positive expression of LAT1 was an independent factor for predicting a poor prognosis. There was a significant correlation between LAT1 expression and Ki-67 labelling index. LAT1 expression is a promising pathological factor to predict the prognosis in patients with resectable stage I-III NSCLC. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most tumor cell membranes overexpress l-type amino acid transporter 1, while normal cell membranes contain l-type amino acid transporter 2; both are Na+-independent amino acid transporters. Therefore, compounds that selectively inhibit l-type amino acid transporter 1 offer researchers with a novel cancer molecular target. Synthetic chemistry efforts and in vitro screening have produced a variety of novel compounds possessing high in vitrol-type amino acid transporter 1 selectivity; KYT-0353 was one such compound. The present studies illustrate that KYT-0353 inhibited 14C-leucine uptake and cell growth in human colon cancer-derived HT-29 cells; IC50s were 0.06 $\mu$. m and 4.1 $\mu$. m, respectively. KYT-0353 also inhibited 14C-leucine uptake in mouse renal proximal tubule cells expressing l-type amino acid transporter 1, and inhibited cell growth; IC50s were 0.14 $\mu$. m and 16.4 $\mu$. m, respectively. Compared to control animals, intravenously administered KYT-0353 (12.5 mg/kg and 25.0 mg/kg) showed statistically significant growth inhibition against HT-29 tumors transplanted to nude mice with maximal inhibition ratios of 65.9% and 77.2%, respectively. Body weight increase with time - a safety indicator - was slightly depressed at 12.5 mg/kg and 25.0 mg/kg with maximal ratios of 3.7% (day 2) and 6.3% (day 11), respectively. Thus, KYT-0353 showed significant growth inhibitory effects on HT-29 cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas it only caused a slight body weight depression. Therefore, KYT-0353 appears to have potential as a novel anti-tumor agent, presumably via selective in vivol-type amino acid transporter 1 inhibition. {\textcopyright} 2009 Japanese Cancer Association.},

Upregulated LAT1 expression is considered to be associated with cancer cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated LAT1 expression in 210 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and 40 patients with colonic adenoma using an immunohistochemical method, and analyzed the associations between LAT1 expression and clinicopatho- logical factors and prognosis. The biological significance of LAT1 was also examined under conditions with sub-normal amounts of essential amino acids using colon cancer cell lines. High expression of LAT1 was observed in 152 of 210 CRC patients (72.4%) and 12 of 40 patients with colonic adenoma (30%), and this difference in the frequency of LAT1 expression between CRC and adenoma was significant (P<0.001). High expression of LAT1 was associated with venous invasion (P=0.027). The restriction of amino acids suppressed cell proliferation in CRC cells with higher LAT1 expression, while cellular proliferation was not suppressed in the cells expressing lower levels of LAT1. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression was also downregulated under restricted availability of amino acids, suggesting that the restriction of amino acids induced an antitumor effect through inhibition of the LAT1/mTOR pathway. In summary, the present study demonstrated that LAT1 expression is frequently upregulated in CRC and is associated with cancer cell proliferation via the mTOR pathway.},

abstract = {There are three known high-affinity targets for cocaine: the dopamine transporter (DAT), the serotonin transporter (SERT), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Decades of studies support the dopamine (DA) hypothesis that the blockade of DAT and the subsequent increase in extracellular DA primarily mediate cocaine reward and reinforcement. Contrary to expectations, DAT knock-out (DAT-KO) mice and SERT or NET knockout mice still self-administer cocaine and/or display conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine, which led to the reevaluation of the DA hypothesis and the proposal of redundant reward pathways. To study the role of DAT in cocaine reward, we have generated a knockin mouse line carrying a functional DAT that is insensitive to cocaine. In these mice, cocaine suppressed locomotor activity, did not elevate extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens, and did not produce reward as measured by CPP. This result suggests that blockade of DAT is necessary for cocaine reward in mice with a functional DAT. This mouse model is unique in that it is specifically designed to differentiate the role of DAT from the roles of NET and SERT in cocaine-induced biochemical and behavioral effects. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {We investigated the transport of levodopa from blood to brain in control and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) parkinsonian monkeys by using intracerebral microdialysis. The degree of parkinsonism was established by the monkey's clinical score and its postmortem striatali dopamine level. We administered levodopa plus carbidopa either orally or by intravenous injection. We estimated the blood-to-brain transport of levodopa as the ratio of its concentration in the brain's extracellular fluid to that in arterial plasma. This ratio was reduced in the MPTP parkinsonian monkeys, and we found an inverse relationship between the monkeys' ability to transport levodopa from blood to brain and their degree of parkinsonism. The oral administration of a high-protein meal or the intravenous infusion of large neutral amino acids before the administration of the levodopa plus carbidopa reduced the transport of levodopa into the brain, as measured by microdialysate collected from the striatum. We found that in two animals an intraperitoneal injection of the $\beta$-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased the blood-to-brain transport of levodopa. Pharmacologic manipulation of the transport of levodopa from blood to brain may offer a new strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. {\textcopyright} 1994 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract = {The SLC6 family is a diverse set of transporters that mediate solute translocation across cell plasma membranes by coupling solute transport to the cotransport of sodium and chloride down their electrochemical gradients. These transporters probably have 12 transmembrane domains, with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails, and at least some may function as homo-oligomers. Family members include the transporters for the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine, the aminergic transmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, the osmolytes betaine and taurine, the amino acid proline, and the metabolic compound creatine. In addition, this family includes a system B0+ cationic and neutral amino acid transporter, and two transporters for which the solutes are unknown. In general, SLC6 transporters act to regulate the level of extracellular solute concentrations. In the central and the peripheral nervous system, these transporters can regulate signaling among neurons, are the sites of action of various drugs of abuse, and naturally occurring mutations in several of these proteins are associated with a variety of neurological disorders. For example, transgenic animals lacking specific aminergic transporters show profoundly disturbed behavioral phenotypes and probably represent excellent systems for investigating psychiatric disease. SLC6 transporters are also found in many non-neural tissues, including kidney, intestine, and testis, consistent with their diverse physiological roles. Transporters in this family represent attractive therapeutic targets because they are subject to multiple forms of regulation by many different signaling cascades, and because a number of pharmacological agents have been identified that act specifically on these proteins.},

In Escherichia coli, expression of glutamate decarboxylase (GadB), a 330 kDa hexamer, is induced to maintain the physiological pH under acidic conditions, like those of the passage through the stomach en route to the intestine. GadB, together with the antiporter GadC, constitutes the gad acid resistance system, which confers the ability for bacterial survival for at least 2 h in a strongly acidic environment. GadB undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change and exhibits an activity optimum at low pH. We determined the crystal structures of GadB at acidic and neutral pH. They reveal the molecular details of the conformational change and the structural basis for the acidic pH optimum. We demonstrate that the enzyme is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm at neutral pH, but is recruited to the membrane when the pH falls. We show by structure-based site-directed mutagenesis that the triple helix bundle formed by the N-termini of the protein at acidic pH is the major determinant for this behaviour.},

However, structural determination of membrane proteins has made tremendous progress in the past years. Concurrently the field of soluble computational design has made impressive inroads. These developments allow us to tackle the formidable challenge of designing functional membrane proteins. Herein, Rosetta is benchmarked for membrane protein design. We evaluate strategies to cope with the often reduced quality of experimental membrane protein structures. Further, we test the usage of symmetry in design protocols, which is particularly important as many membrane proteins exist as homo-oligomers. We compare a soluble scoring function with a scoring function optimized for membrane proteins, RosettaMembrane. Both scoring functions recovered around half of the native sequence when completely redesigning membrane proteins. However, RosettaMembrane recovered the most native-like amino acid property composition. While leucine was overrepresented in the inner and outer-hydrophobic regions of RosettaMembrane designs, it resulted in a native-like surface hydrophobicity indicating that it is currently the best option for designing membrane proteins with Rosetta.},

Here, we present a case study of rhodopsin fold determination by integrating sparse and/or low-resolution restraints from multiple experimental techniques including electron microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Simultaneous incorporation of orthogonal experimental restraints not only significantly improved the sampling accuracy but also allowed identification of the correct fold, which is demonstrated by a protein size-normalized transmembrane root-mean-square deviation as low as 1.2 {\AA}. The protocol developed in this case study can be used for the determination of unknown membrane protein folds when limited experimental restraints are available. Xia et al. developed a computational structure prediction pipeline to utilize multiple experimental restraints to fold membrane proteins in BCL and Rosetta. The pipeline described herein could determine structures to an accuracy of 1.2 {\AA} RMSD relative to the experimentally determined structural model.},

abstract = {Amino acid transporters are essential components of prokaryote and eukaryote cells, possess distinct physiological functions, and differ markedly in substrate specificity. Amino acid transporters can be both drug targets and drug transporters (bioavailability, targeting) with many monogenic disorders resulting from dysfunctional membrane transport. The largest collection of amino acid transporters (including the mammalian SLC6, SLC7, SLC32, SLC36, and SLC38 families), across all kingdoms of life, is within the Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation (APC) superfamily. The LeuT-fold is a paradigm structure for APC superfamily amino acid transporters and carriers of sugars, neurotransmitters, electrolytes, osmolytes, vitamins, micronutrients, signalling molecules, and organic and fatty acids. Each transporter is specific for a unique sub-set of solutes, specificity being determined by how well a substrate fits into each binding pocket. However, the molecular basis of substrate selectivity remains, by and large, elusive. Using an integrated computational and experimental approach, we demonstrate that a single position within the LeuT-fold can play a crucial role in determining substrate specificity in mammalian and arthropod amino acid transporters within the APC superfamily. Systematic mutation of the amino acid residue occupying the equivalent position to LeuT V104 titrates binding pocket space resulting in dramatic changes in substrate selectivity in exemplar APC amino acid transporters including PAT2 (SLC36A2) and SNAT5 (SLC38A5). Our work demonstrates how a single residue/site within an archetypal structural motif can alter substrate affinity and selectivity within this important superfamily of diverse membrane transporters.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS), targets of antidepressants and psychostimulants, clear neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft through sodium (Na+)-coupled transport. Substrate and Na+ are thought to be transported from the extracellular to intracellular space through an alternating access mechanism by coordinated conformational rearrangements in the symporter that alternately expose the binding sites to each side of the membrane. However, the mechanism by which the binding of ligands coordinates conformational changes occurring on opposite sides of the membrane is not well understood. Here, we report the use of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) techniques to image transitions between distinct conformational states on both the extracellular and intracellular sides of the prokaryotic NSS LeuT, including partially open intermediates associated with transport activity. The nature and functional context of these hitherto unidentified intermediate states shed new light on the allosteric mechanism that couples substrate and Na+ symport by the NSS family through conformational dynamics.},

abstract = {Members of the SLC11 (NRAMP) family transport iron and other transition-metal ions across cellular membranes. These membrane proteins are present in all kingdoms of life with a high degree of sequence conservation. To gain insight into the determinants of ion selectivity, we have determined the crystal structure of Staphylococcus capitis DMT (ScaDMT), a close prokaryotic homolog of the family. ScaDMT shows a familiar architecture that was previously identified in the amino acid permease LeuT. The protein adopts an inward-facing conformation with a substrate-binding site located in the center of the transporter. This site is composed of conserved residues, which coordinate Mn 2+, Fe 2+ and Cd 2+ but not Ca 2+. Mutations of interacting residues affect ion binding and transport in both ScaDMT and human DMT1. Our study thus reveals a conserved mechanism for transition-metal ion selectivity within the SLC11 family.},

abstract = {Proteins fold to their lowest free-energy structures, and hence the most straightforward way to increase the accuracy of a partially incorrect protein structure model is to search for the lowest-energy nearby structure. This direct approach has met with little success for two reasons: first, energy function inaccuracies can lead to false energy minima, resulting in model degradation rather than improvement; and second, even with an accurate energy function, the search problem is formidable because the energy only drops considerably in the immediate vicinity of the global minimum, and there are a very large number of degrees of freedom. Here we describe a large-scale energy optimization-based refinement method that incorporates advances in both search and energy function accuracy that can substantially improve the accuracy of low-resolution homology models. The method refined low-resolution homology models into correct folds for 50 of 84 diverse protein families and generated improved models in recent blind structure prediction experiments. Analyses of the basis for these improvements reveal contributions from both the improvements in conformational sampling techniques and the energy function.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling has qualitatively shown that a key event during activation of rhodopsin is a rigid-body movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) at the cytoplasmic surface of the molecule. To place this result on a quantitative footing, and to identify movements of other helices upon photoactivation, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy was used to determine distances and distance changes between pairs of nitroxide side chains introduced in helices at the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin. Sixteen pairs were selected from a set of nine individual sites, each located on the solvent exposed surface of the protein where structural perturbation due to the presence of the label is minimized. Importantly, the EPR spectra of the labeled proteins change little or not at all upon photoactivation, suggesting that rigid-body motions of helices rather than rearrangement of the nitroxide side chains are responsible for observed distance changes. For inactive rhodopsin, it was possible to find a globally minimized arrangement of nitroxide locations that simultaneously satisfied the crystal structure of rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank entry 1GZM), the experimentally measured distance data, and the known rotamers of the nitroxide side chain. A similar analysis of the data for activated rhodopsin yielded a new geometry consistent with a 5-{\AA} outward movement of TM6 and smaller movements involving TM1, TM7, and the C-terminal sequence following helix H8. The positions of nitroxides in other helices at the cytoplasmic surface remained largely unchanged. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {ExoU is a type III-secreted cytotoxin expressing A2 phospholipase activity when injected into eukaryotic target cells by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The enzymatic activity of ExoU is undetectable in vitro unless ubiquitin, a required cofactor, is added to the reaction. The role of ubiquitin in facilitating ExoU enzymatic activity is poorly understood but of significance for designing inhibitors to prevent tissue injury during infections with strains of P. aeruginosa producing this toxin. Most ubiquitin-binding proteins, including ExoU, demonstrate a low (micromolar) affinity for monoubiquitin (monoUb). Additionally, ExoU is a large and dynamic protein, limiting the applicability of traditional structural techniques such as NMR and X-ray crystallography to define this protein-protein interaction. Recent advancements in computational methods, however, have allowed high-resolution protein modeling using sparse data. In this study, we combine double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and Rosetta modeling to identify potential binding interfaces of ExoU and monoUb. The lowestenergy scoring model was tested using biochemical, biophysical, and biological techniques. To verify the binding interface, Rosetta was used to design a panel of mutations to modulate binding, including one variant with enhanced binding affinity. Our analyses show the utility of computational modeling when combined with sensitive biological assays and biophysical approaches that are exquisitely suited for large dynamic proteins.},

abstract = {Sodium-dependent transporters couple the flow of Na+ ions down their electrochemical potential gradient to the uphill transport of various ligands. Many of these transporters share a common core structure composed of a five-helix inverted repeat and deliver their cargo utilizing an alternating-access mechanism. A detailed characterization of inward-facing conformations of the Na+-dependent sugar transporter from Vibrio parahaemolyticus (vSGLT) has previously been reported, but structural details on additional conformations and on howNa+ and ligand influence the equilibrium between other states remains unknown. Here, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, structural modeling, and molecular dynamics are utilized to deduce ligand-dependent equilibria shifts of vSGLT in micelles. In the absence and presence of saturating amounts of Na+, vSGLT favors an inward-facing conformation. Upon binding both Na+ and sugar, the equilibrium shifts toward either an outwardfacing or occluded conformation.While Na+ alone does not stabilize the outward-facing state, gating charge calculations together with a kinetic model of transport suggest that the resting negative membrane potential of the cell, absent in detergent-solubilized samples, may stabilize vSGLT in an outward-open conformation where it is poised for binding external sugars. In total, these findings provide insights into ligand-induced conformational selection and delineate the transport cycle of vSGLT.},

Comprehensive understanding of bacterial acid resistance is important for prevention and clinical treatment. In this study, we report a previously uncharacterized type of acid resistance system in E. coli that relies on L-glutamine (Gln), one of the most abundant food-borne free amino acids. Upon uptake into E. coli, Gln is converted to L-glutamate (Glu) by the acid-activated glutaminase YbaS, with concomitant release of gaseous ammonia. The free ammonia neutralizes proton, resulting in elevated intracellular pH under acidic environment. We show that YbaS and the amino acid antiporter GadC, which exchanges extracellular Gln with intracellular Glu, together constitute an acid resistance system that is sufficient for E. coli survival under extremely acidic environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 IBCB, SIBS, CAS.

abstract = {Glutamate decarboxylase B (GadB) from Escherichia coli is a highly active biocatalyst that can convert l-glutamate to $\gamma$-aminobutyrate (GABA), a precursor of 2-pyrrolidone (a monomer of Nylon 4). In contrast to vigorous studies of pH shifting of GadB, mesophilic GadB has not been stabilized by protein engineering. In this study, we improved the thermostability of GadB through structural optimization of its N-terminal interdomain. According to structural analysis, the N-terminal fourteen residues (1-14) of homo-hexameric GadB formed a triple-helix bundle interdomain at acidic pH and contributed to the thermostability of GadB in preliminary tests as the pH shifted from 7.6 to 4.6. GadB thermostabilization was achieved by optimization of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions at the N-terminal interdomain. A triple mutant (GadB-TM: Gln5Asp/Val6Ile/Thr7Glu) showed higher thermostability than the wild-type (GadB-WT), i.e., 7.9 and 7.7Â°C increases in the melting temperature (Tm) and the temperature at which 50% of the initial activity remained after 10min incubation (T5010), respectively. The triple mutant showed no reduction of catalytic activity in enzyme kinetics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at high temperature showed that reinforced interactions of the triple mutant rigidified the N-terminal interdomain compared to the wild-type, leading to GadB thermostabilization. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Given that previous studies had suggested a highly asymmetric structure for cdb3 and that pH dependent structural transitions of cdb3 have been reported, the structure of cdb3 in solution at neutral pH was investigated via site-directed spin labeling in combination with conventional electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopies. These studies show that the structure of the central compact dimer (residues 55-356) is indistinguishable from the crystal structure determined at pH 4.8. N-Terminal residues 1-54 and C-terminal residues 357-379 are dynamically disordered and show no indications of stable secondary structure.

abstract = {A key issue in macromolecular structure modeling is the granularity of the molecular representation. A fine-grained representation can approximate the actual structure more accurately, but may require many more degrees of freedom than a coarse-grained representation and hence make conformational search more challenging. We investigate this tradeoff between the accuracy and the size of protein conformational search space for two frequently used representations: one with fixed bond angles and lengths and one that has full flexibility. We performed large-scale explorations of the energy landscapes of 82 protein domains under each model, and find that the introduction of bond angle flexibility significantly increases the average energy gap between native and non-native structures. We also find that incorporating bonded geometry flexibility improves low resolution X-ray crystallographic refinement. These results suggest that backbone bond angle relaxation makes an important contribution to native structure energetics, that current energy functions are sufficiently accurate to capture the energetic gain associated with subtle deformations from chain ideality, and more speculatively, that backbone geometry distortions occur late in protein folding to optimize packing in the native state. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Protein Society.},

The algorithm is based on a hierarchical workflow and can be parallelized on supercomputers with up to 128,000 compute cores with near perfect efficiency. Such scaling behavior is notable, as with Moore's law continuing only in the number of cores per chip, parallelizability is a critical property of new algorithms.

abstract = {The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus catalyzes the uptake of lactose in an exchange reaction with intracellularly formed galactose. The interactions between the substrate and the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site of LacS have been characterized by assaying binding and transport of a range of sugars in proteoliposomes, in which the purified protein was reconstituted with a unidirectional orientation. Specificity for galactoside binding is given by the spatial configuration of the C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the galactose moiety. Except for a C-4 methoxy substitution, replacement of the hydroxyl groups for bulkier groups is not tolerated at these positions. Large hydrophobic or hydrophilic substitutions on the galactose C-1 alpha or beta position did not impair transport. In fact, the hydrophobic groups increased the binding affinity but decreased transport rates compared with galactose. Binding and transport characteristics of deoxygalactosides from either side of the membrane showed that the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site interact differently with galactose. Compared with galactose, the IC(50) values for 2-deoxy- and 6-deoxygalactose at the cytoplasmic binding site were increased 150- and 20-fold, respectively, whereas they were the same at the extracellular binding site. From these and other experiments, we conclude that the binding sites and translocation pathway of LacS are spacious along the C-1 to C-4 axis of the galactose moiety and are restricted along the C-2 to C-6 axis. The differences in affinity at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site ensure that the transport via LacS is highly asymmetrical for the two opposing directions of translocation.},

abstract = {Background: Type II ABC importers transport diverse substrates into the cell. Results: EPR on BtuCD-F in liposomes shows the response of cytoplasmic gate II during nucleotide cycle in the presence of substrate. Conclusion: The cytoplasmic gate II closes with substrate and ATP as in the x-ray structure. Substrate can be released after hydrolysis. Significance: There is new insight into the mechanism of transport in membranes. Double electron-electron resonance is used here to investigate intermediates of the transport cycle of the Escherichia coli vitamin B12 ATP-binding cassette importer BtuCD-F. Previously, we showed the ATP-induced opening of the cytoplasmic gate I in TM5 helices, later confirmed by the AMP-PNP-bound BtuCD-F crystal structure. Here, other key residues are analyzed in TM10 helices (positions 307 and 322) and in the cytoplasmic gate II, i.e. the loop between TM2 and TM3 (positions 82 and 85). Without BtuF, binding of ATP induces detectable changes at positions 307 and 85 in BtuCD in liposomes. Together with BtuF, ATP triggers the closure of the cytoplasmic gate II in liposomes (reported by both positions 82 and 85). This forms a sealed cavity in the translocation channel in agreement with the AMP-PNP{\textperiodcentered}BtuCD-F x-ray structure. When vitamin B12 and AMP-PNP are simultaneously present, the extent of complex formation is reduced, but the short 82-82 interspin distance detected indicates that the substrate does not affect the closed conformation of this gate. The existence of the BtuCD-F complex under these conditions is verified with spectroscopically orthogonal nitroxide and Gd(III)-based labels. The cytoplasmic gate II remains closed also in the vanadate-trapped state, but it reopens in the ADP-bound state of the complex. Therefore, we suggest that the substrate likely trapped in ATPBtuCD-F can be released after ATP hydrolysis but before the occluded ADPbound conformation is reached.{\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Distance measurements by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance techniques are increasingly applied to multiple-spin systems. In the double electron-electron resonance experiment, more than two dipolar coupled spins manifest in an increased total modulation depth and in sum and difference dipolar frequency contributions that give rise to additional peaks appearing in the distance distribution, which do not correspond to the real interspin distances of the system and are hence referred to as ghost contributions. These ghost contributions may be so prominent that they might be mistaken for real distance peaks or that real distance peaks shift their position or disappear. We present a simple approximate procedure to suppress ghost distances to a great extent by manipulating the experimentally obtained form factor during data analysis by a simple power scaling with a scaling exponent $\zeta$N = 1/(1-N), with N being the number of coupled spins in the system. This approach requires neither further experimental effort nor exact knowledge about labelling and inversion efficiency. This should enable routine application to biological systems. The approach is validated on simulated test cases for up to five spins and applied to synthetic model samples. The suppression of ghost distances with the presented approach works best for symmetric geometries and rigid molecules which, at the same time, are the cases where ghost contributions are most disturbing. The distance distributions obtained by power scaling are consistent with distributions that were obtained with previously obtained alternative approaches and agree, in some cases, strikingly well with the expectations for the true interspin distance distributions.

abstract = {A simple generic method for optimizing membrane protein overexpression in Escherichia coli is still lacking. We have studied the physiological response of the widely used "Walker strains" C41(DE3) and C43(DE3), which are derived from BL21(DE3), to membrane protein overexpression. For unknown reasons, overexpression of many membrane proteins in these strains is hardly toxic, often resulting in high overexpression yields. By using a combination of physiological, proteomic, and genetic techniques we have shown that mutations in the lacUV5 promoter governing expression of T7 RNA polymerase are key to the improved membrane protein overexpression characteristics of the Walker strains. Based on this observation, we have engineered a derivative strain of E. coli BL21(DE3), termed Lemo21(DE3), in which the activity of the T7 RNA polymerase can be precisely controlled by its natural inhibitor T7 lysozyme (T7Lys). Lemo21(DE3) is tunable for membrane protein overexpression and conveniently allows optimizing overexpression of any given membrane protein by using only a single strain rather than a multitude of different strains. The generality and simplicity of our approach make it ideal for high-throughput applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The arginine-dependent extreme acid resistance system helps enteric bacteria survive the harsh gastric environment. At the center of this multiprotein system is an arginine-agmatine antiporter, AdiC. To maintain cytoplasmic pH, AdiC imports arginine and exports its decarboxylated product, agmatine, resulting in a net extrusion of one "virtual proton" in each turnover. The random orientation of AdiC in reconstituted liposomes throws up an obstacle to quantifying its transport mechanism. To overcome this problem, we introduced a mutation, S26C, near the substrate-binding site. This mutant exhibits substrate recognition and pH-dependent activity similar to those of the wild-type protein but loses function completely upon reaction with thiol reagents. The membrane-impermeant MTSES reagent can then be used as a cleanly sided inhibitor to silence those S26C-AdiC proteins whose extracellular portion projects from the external side of the liposome. Alternatively, the membrane-permeant MTSEA and membrane-impermeant reducing reagent, TCEP, can be used together to inhibit proteins in the opposite orientation. This approach allows steady-state kinetic analysis of AdiC in a sided fashion. Arginine and agmatine have similar Michaelis-Menten parameters for both sides of the protein, while the extracellular side selects arginine over argininamide, a mimic of the carboxylate-protonated form of arginine, more effectively than does the cytoplasmic side. Moreover, the two sides of AdiC have different pH sensitivities. AdiC activity increases to a plateau at pH 4 as the extracellular side is acidified, while the cytoplasmic side shows an optimal pH of 5.5, with further acidification inhibiting transport. This oriented system allows more precise analysis of AdiC-mediated substrate transport than has been previously available and permits comparison to the situation experienced by the bacterial membrane under acid stress. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Food-borne hemorrhagic Escherichia coli, exemplified by the strains O157:H7 and O104:H4 (refs1, 2), require elaborate acid-resistance systems (ARs) to survive the extremely acidic environment such as the stomach (pHâ2). AR2 expels intracellular protons through the decarboxylation of l-glutamate (Glu) in the cytoplasm and exchange of the reaction product $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with extracellular Glu. The latter process is mediated by the Glu-GABA antiporter GadC, a representative member of the amino-acid-polyamine- organocation superfamily of membrane transporters. The functional mechanism of GadC remains largely unknown. Here we show, with the use of an in vitro proteoliposome-based assay, that GadC transports GABA/Glu only under acidic conditions, with no detectable activity at pHvalues higher than 6.5. We determined the crystal structure of E.coli GadC at 3.1{\AA} resolution under basic conditions. GadC, comprising 12 transmembrane segments (TMs), exists in a closed state, with its carboxy-terminal domain serving as a plug to block an otherwise inward-open conformation. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal the essential transport residues, identify the transport path and suggest a conserved transport mechanism involving the rigid-body rotation of a helical bundle for GadC and other amino acid antiporters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we elucidate detailed events of substrate binding, through a combination of crystallography, molecular dynamics, site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical/biophysical assays, and the design and synthesis of novel ligands. We show precisely where 5-substituted hydantoin substrates bind in an extended configuration at the interface of the bundle and hash domains. They are recognised through hydrogen bonds to the hydantoin moiety and the complementarity of the 5-substituent for a hydrophobic pocket in the protein. Furthermore, we describe a novel structure of an intermediate state of the protein with the external thin gate locked open by an inhibitor, 5-(2-naphthylmethyl)-L-hydantoin, which becomes a substrate when leucine 363 is changed to an alanine. We deduce the molecular events that underlie acquisition and transport of a ligand by Mhp1.},

abstract = {Which properties of the membrane environment are essential for the folding and oligomerization of transmembrane proteins? Because the lipids that surround membrane proteins in situ spontaneously organize into bilayers, it may seem intuitive that interactions with the bilayer provide both hydrophobic and topological constraints that help the protein to achieve a stable and functional three-dimensional structure. However, one may wonder whether folding is actually driven by the membrane environment or whether the folded state just reflects an adaptation of integral proteins to the medium in which they function. Also, apart from the overall transmembrane orientation, might the asymmetry inherent in biosynthesis processes cause proteins to fold to out-of-equilibrium, metastable topologies? Which of the features of a bilayer are essential for membrane protein folding, and which are not? To which extent do translocons dictate transmembrane topologies? Recent data show that many membrane proteins fold and oligomerize very efficiently in media that bear little similarity to a membrane, casting doubt on the essentiality of many bilayer constraints. In the following discussion, we argue that some of the features of bilayers may contribute to protein folding, stability and regulation, but they are not required for the basic three-dimensional structure to be achieved. This idea, if correct, would imply that evolution has steered membrane proteins toward an accommodation to biosynthetic pathways and a good fit into their environment, but that their folding is not driven by the latter or dictated by insertion apparatuses. In other words, the three-dimensional structure of membrane proteins is essentially determined by intramolecular interactions and not by bilayer constraints and insertion pathways. Implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A), a member of the atypical $\alpha$-kinase family, phosphorylates sites in the myosin II tail that block filament assembly. Here we show that the catalytic activity of A-CAT, the $\alpha$-kinase domain of MHCKA (residues 552-841), is severely inhibited by the removal of a disordered C-terminal tail sequence (C-tail; residues 806-841). The key residue in the C-tail was identified as Thr 825, which was found to be constitutively autophosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of Thr825 using shrimp alkaline phosphatase decreased A-CAT activity. The activity of a truncated A-CAT lacking Thr 825 could be rescued by Pi, phosphothreonine, and a phosphorylated peptide, but not by threonine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or an unphosphorylated peptide. These results focused attention on a P i-binding pocket located in the C-terminal lobe of A-CAT. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the Pi-pocket was essential for A-CAT activity. Based on these results, it is proposed that autophosphorylation of Thr825 activates ACAT by providing a covalently tethered ligand for the Pi-pocket. Ab initio modeling studies using the Rosetta FloppyTail and Flex-PepDock protocols showed that it is feasible for the phosphorylated Thr825 to dock intramolecularly into the P i-pocket. Allosteric activation is predicted to involve a conformational change in Arg734, which bridges the bound P i to Asp762 in a key active site loop. Sequence alignments indicate that a comparable regulatory mechanism is likely to be conserved in Dictyostelium MHCKB-D and metazoan eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinases. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

However, it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking, and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency. Here we present a reformulation of the Rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein-protein docking. The new method is based on a "fold-tree" representation of the molecular system, which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid-body degrees of freedom. Problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees. The explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near-native and incorrect models.},

In this study, we present Rosetta FlexPepDock, a novel tool for refining coarse peptide-protein models that allows significant changes in both peptide backbone and side chains. We obtain high resolution models, often of sub-angstrom backbone quality, over an extensive and general benchmark that is based on a large nonredundant dataset of 89 peptide-protein interactions. Importantly, side chains of known binding motifs are modeled particularly well, typically with atomic accuracy. In addition, our protocol has improved modeling quality for the important application of cross docking to PDZ domains.

abstract = {ExoU is a 74 kDa cytotoxin that undergoes substantial conformational changes as part of its function, that is, it has multiple thermodynamically stable conformations that interchange depending on its environment. Such flexible proteins pose unique challenges to structural biology: (1) not only is it often difficult to determine structures by X-ray crystallography for all biologically relevant conformations because of the flat energy landscape (2) but also experimental conditions can easily perturb the biologically relevant conformation. The first challenge can be overcome by applying orthogonal structural biology techniques that are capable of observing alternative, biologically relevant conformations. The second challenge can be addressed by determining the structure in the same biological state with two independent techniques under different experimental conditions. If both techniques converge to the same structural model, the confidence that an unperturbed biologically relevant conformation is observed increases. To this end, we determine the structure of the C-terminal domain of the effector protein, ExoU, from data obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with site-directed spin labeling and in silico de novo structure determination. Our protocol encompasses a multimodule approach, consisting of low-resolution topology sampling, clustering, and high-resolution refinement. The resulting model was compared with an ExoU model in complex with its chaperone SpcU obtained previously by X-ray crystallography. The two models converged to a minimal RMSD100 of 3.2 {\AA}, providing evidence that the unbound structure of ExoU matches the fold observed in complex with SpcU.},

This makes it an interesting study case for aggregation phenomenon in general. One of the most well-known examples of a functional amyloid, E. coli curli, is an essential component in the formation of bacterial biofilm, and is primarily formed by aggregates of the protein CsgA. Previous studies have shown that the minor sequence variations observed in the five different subrepeats (R1-R5), which comprise the CsgA primary sequence, have a substantial influence on their individual aggregation propensities. Using a recently described diffusion-optimized enhanced sampling approach for Monte Carlo simulations, we here investigate the equilibrium properties of the monomeric and dimeric states of these subrepeats, to probe whether structural properties observed in these early stage oligomers are decisive for the characteristics of the resulting aggregate. We show that the dimerization propensities of these peptides have strong correlations with their propensity for amyloid formation, and provide structural insights into the inter- and intramolecular contacts that appear to be essential in this process.},

We show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required for PI5P-dependent activation of Akt in infected HeLa cells or cells ectopically expressing IpgD. Cells treated with PI5P had increased numbers of early endosomes with activated EGFR, no detectable EGFR in the late endosomal or lysosomal compartments, and prolonged EGFR signaling. Endosomal recycling and retrograde pathways were spared, indicating that the effect of PI5P on the degradative route to the late endocytic compartments was specific. Thus, we identified PI5P, which was enriched in endosomes, as a regulator of vesicular trafficking that alters growth factor receptor signaling by impairing lysosomal degradation, a property used by S. flexneri to favor survival of host cells.},

abstract = {Stationary-phase cultures of Escherichia coli can survive several hours of exposure to extreme acid (pH 2 to 3), a level well below the pH range for growth (pH 4.5 to 9). To identify the genes needed for survival in extreme acid, a microtiter screening procedure was devised. Colonies from a Tn10 transposon pool in E. coli MC4100 were inoculated into buffered Luria broth, pH 7.0, in microtiter wells, grown overnight, and then diluted in Luria broth, pH 2.5, at 37Â°C for 2 h. From 3,000 isolates screened, 3 Tet' strains were identified as extremely acid sensitive (<0.1% survival at pH 2.5 for 2 h). Flanking sequences of the Tn10 inserts were amplified by inverse PCR. The sequences encoded a hydrophobic partial peptide of 88 residues. A random- primer-generated probe hybridized to Kohara clones 279 and 280 at 32 min (33.7 min on the revised genomic map EcoMap7) near gadB (encoding glutamate decarboxylase). The gene was designated xasA for extreme acid sensitive. xasA::Tn10 strains grown at pH 7 to 8 showed 100-fold-less survival in acid than the parent strain. Growth in mild acid (pH 5 to 6) restored acid resistance; anaerobiosis was not required, as it is for acid resistance in rpoS strains. xasA::Tn10 eliminated enhancement of acid resistance by glutamic acid. xasA was found to be a homolog of gadC recently sequenced in Shigella flexneri, in which it appears to encode a permease for the decarboxylated product of GadB. These results suggest that GadC (XasA) participates in a glutamate decarboxylase alkalinization cycle to protect E. coli from cytoplasmic acidification. The role of the glutamate cycle is particularly important for cultures grown at neutral pH before exposure to extreme acid.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli K-12 strains and Shigella flexneri grown to stationary phase can survive several hours at pH 2 to 3, which is considerably lower than the acid limit for growth (about pH 4.5). A 1.3-kb fragment cloned from S. flexneri conferred acid resistance on acid-sensitive E. coli HB101; sequence data identified the fragment as a homolog of rpoS, the growth phase- dependent sigma factor $\sigma$38. The clone also conferred acid resistance on S. flexneri rpoS::Tn10 but not on Salmonella typhimurium. E. coli and S. flexneri strains containing wild-type rpoS maintained greater internal pH in the face of a low external pH than strains lacking functional rpoS, but the ability to survive at low pH did not require maintenance of a high transmembrane pH difference. Aerobic stationary-phase cultures of E. coli MC4100 and S. flexneri 3136, grown initially at an external pH range of 5 to 8, were 100% acid resistant (surviving 2 h at pH 2.5). Aerobic log-phase cultures grown at pH 5.0 were acid resistant; survival decreased 10- to 100- fold as the pH of growth was increased to pH 8.0. Extended growth in log phase also decreased acid resistance substantially. Strains containing rpoS::Tn10 showed partial acid resistance when grown at pH 5 to stationary phase; log-phase cultures showed <0.01% acid resistance. When grown anaerobically at low pH, however, the rpoS::Tn10 strains were acid resistant. E. coli MC4100 also showed resistance at alkaline pH outside the growth range (base resistance). Significant base resistance was observed up to pH 10.2. Base resistance was diminished by rpoS::Tn10 and by the presence of Na+. Base resistance was increased by an order of magnitude for stationary-phase cultures grown in moderate base (pH 8) compared with those grown in moderate acid (pH 5). Anaerobic growth partly restored base resistance in cultures grown at pH 5 but not in those grown at pH 8. Thus, both acid resistance and base resistance show dependence on growth pH and are regulated by rpoS under certain conditions. For acid resistance, and in part for base resistance, the rpoS requirement can be overcome by anaerobic growth in moderate acid.},

abstract = {Adaptation to acid stress is an important factor in the transmission of intestinal microbes. The enterobacterium Escherichia coli uses a range of physiological, metabolic, and proton-consuming acid resistance mechanisms in order to survive acid stresses as low as pH 2.0. The physiological adaptations include membrane modifications and outer membrane porins to reduce proton influx and periplasmic and cytoplasmic chaperones to manage the effects of acid damage. The metabolic acid resistance systems couple proton efflux to energy generation via select components of the electron transport chain, including cytochrome bo oxidase, NADH dehydrogenase I, NADH dehydrogenase II, and succinate dehydrogenase. Under anaerobic conditions the formate hydrogen lyase complex catalyzes conversion of cytoplasmic protons to hydrogen gas. Finally, each major proton-consuming acid resistance system has a pyridoxal-5â²- phosphate-dependent amino acid decarboxylase that catalyzes proton-dependent decarboxylation of a substrate amino acid to product and CO2, and an inner membrane antiporter that exchanges external substrate for internal product. {\textcopyright} Copyright {\textcopyright}2013 by Annual Reviews.

abstract = {We developed a Rosetta-based Monte Carlo method to calculate the pK a values of protein residues that commonly exhibit variable protonation states (Asp, Glu, Lys, His, and Tyr). We tested the technique by calculating pKa values for 264 residues from 34 proteins. The standard Rosetta score function, which is independent of any environmental conditions, failed to capture pKa shifts. After incorporating a Coulomb electrostatic potential and optimizing the solvation reference energies for pKa calculations, we employed a method that allowed side-chain flexibility and achieved a root mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.83 from experimental values (0.68 after discounting 11 predictions with an error over 2 pH units). Additional degrees of side-chain conformational freedom for the proximal residues facilitated the capture of charge-charge interactions in a few cases, resulting in an overall RMSD of 0.85 pH units. The addition of backbone flexibility increased the overall RMSD to 0.93 pH units but improved relative pKa predictions for proximal catalytic residues. The method also captures large pKa shifts of lysine and some glutamate point mutations in staphylococcal nuclease. Thus, a simple and fast method based on the Rosetta score function and limited conformational sampling produces pK a values that will be useful when rapid estimation is essential, such as in docking, design, and folding. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Pulsed electron-electron double resonance techniques such as the four-pulse double electron-electron resonance experiment measure a dipolar evolution function of the sample. For a sample consisting of spin-carrying nanoobjects, this function is the product of a form factor, corresponding to the internal structure of the nanoobject, and a background factor, corresponding to the distribution of nanoobjects in space. The form factor contains information on the spin-to-spin distance distribution within the nanoobject and on the average number of spins per nanoobject, while the background factor depends on constraints, such as a confinement of the nanoobjects to a two-dimensional layer. Separation of the dipolar evolution function into these two contributions and extraction of the spin-to-spin distance distribution require numerically stable mathematical algorithms that can handle data for different classes of samples, e.g., spin-labelled biomacromolecules and synthetic materials. Furthermore, experimental imperfections such as the limited excitation bandwidth of microwave pulses need to be considered. The software package DeerAnalysis2006 provides access to a comprehensive set of tools for such data analysis within a common user interface. This interface allows for several tests of the reliability and precision of the extracted information. User-supplied models for the spin-to-spin distance distribution within a certain class of nanoobjects can be added to an existing library and be fitted with a universal algorithm. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {During their transport cycle, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters undergo large-scale conformational changes between inward- and outward-facing states. Using an approach based on designing system-specific reaction coordinates and using nonequilibrium work relations, we have performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of explicit membrane/ solvent to sample a large number of mechanistically distinct pathways for the conformational transition of MsbA, a bacterial ABC exporter whose structure has been solved in multiple functional states. The computational approach developed here is based on (i) extensive exploration of system-specific biasing protocols (e.g., using collective variables designed based on available lowresolution crystal structures) and (ii) using nonequilibrium work relations for comparing the relevance of the transition pathways. The most relevant transition pathway identified using this approach involves several distinct stages reflecting the complex nature of the structural changes associated with the function of the protein. The opening of the cytoplasmic gate during the outwardto inward-facing transition of apo MsbA is found to be disfavored when the periplasmic gate is open and facilitated by a twisting motion of the nucleotide-binding domains that involves a dramatic change in their relative orientation. These results highlight the cooperativity between the transmembrane and the nucleotidebinding domains in the conformational transition of ABC exporters. The approach introduced here provides a framework to study large-scale conformational changes of other membrane transporters whose computational investigation at an atomic resolution may not be currently feasible using conventional methods.},

Here, as a stepping stone, we describe methods to detect alternative conformations in proteins and strategies to model these near-native conformational changes based on backrub-type Monte Carlo moves in Rosetta. We illustrate how Rosetta simulations that apply backrub moves improve modeling of point mutant side-chain conformations, native side-chain conformational heterogeneity, functional conformational changes, tolerated sequence space, protein interaction specificity, and amino acid covariation across protein-protein interfaces. We include relevant Rosetta command lines and RosettaScripts to encourage the application of these types of simulations to other systems. Our work highlights that critical scoring and sampling improvements will be necessary to approximate conformational landscapes.

abstract = {Multistate computational protein design (MSD) with backbone ensembles approximating conformational flexibility can predict higher quality sequences than single-state design with a single fixed backbone. However, it is currently unclear what characteristics of backbone ensembles are required for the accurate prediction of protein sequence stability. In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy of protein stability predictions made with MSD by using a variety of backbone ensembles to recapitulate the experimentally measured stability of 85 Streptococcal protein G domain $\beta$1 sequences. Ensembles tested here include an NMR ensemble as well as those generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, by Backrub motions, and by PertMin, a new method that we developed involving the perturbation of atomic coordinates followed by energy minimization. MSD with the PertMin ensembles resulted in the most accurate predictions by providing the highest number of stable sequences in the top 25, and by correctly binning sequences as stable or unstable with the highest success rate (â90%) and the lowest number of false positives. The performance of PertMin ensembles is due to the fact that their members closely resemble the input crystal structure and have low potential energy. Conversely, the NMR ensemble as well as those generated by MD simulations at 500 or 1000 K reduced prediction accuracy due to their low structural similarity to the crystal structure. The ensembles tested herein thus represent on- or off-target models of the native protein fold and could be used in future studies to design for desired properties other than stability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The bacterial antiporter GadC plays a central role in the glutamate (Glu)-dependent acid resistance system, which protects enteric bacteria against the extreme acidity of the human stomach. Upon acid shock, GadC imports Glu into the cytoplasm, where Glu decarboxylases consume a cytoplasmic proton, which ends up as a "virtual" proton in the decarboxylated product y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and is then exported via GadC. It was therefore proposed that GadC counters intracellular acidification by continually pumping out virtual protons. This scenario, however, is oversimplified. In gastric environments, GadC encounters substrates in multiple carboxyl protonation forms (outside: Glu-, Glu0, Glu+; inside: GABA 0, GABA+). Of the six possible combinations of antiport partners, Glu+/GABAo results in proton influx, Glu o/GABAo and Glu+/GABA+ are proton neutral, and Glu-/GABAo, Glu-/GABA+, or Gluo/GABA+ lead to proton extrusion. Which of these exchanges does GadC catalyze? To attack this problem, we developed an oriented GadC liposome system holding a three-unit inward pH gradient to mimic the conditions facing bacteria in the stomach. By assessing the electrogenicity of substrate transport, we demonstrate that GadC selectively exchanges Glu - or Gluo with GABA+, resulting in effective proton extrusion of 7gt;0.9 H+ per turnover to counter proton invasion into acid-challenged bacteria. We further show that GadC selects among protonated substrates using a charge-based mechanism, rather than directly recognizing the protonation status of the carboxyl groups. This result paves the way for future work to identify the molecular basis of GadC's substrate selectivity.},

abstract = {Due to the acidic nature of the stomach, enteric organisms must withstand extreme acid stress for colonization and pathogenesis. Escherichia coli contains several acid resistance systems that protect cells to pH 2. One acid resistance system, acid resistance system 2 (AR2), requires extracellular glutamate, while another (AR3) requires extracellular arginine. Little is known about how these systems protect cells from acid stress. AR2 and AR3 are thought to consume intracellular protons through amino acid decarboxylation. Antiport mechanisms then exchange decarboxylation products for new amino acid substrates. This form of proton consumption could maintain an internal pH (pHi) conducive to cell survival. The model was tested by estimating the pHi and transmembrane potential ($\delta$$\Psi$) of cells acid stressed at pH 2.5. During acid challenge, glutamate- and arginine-dependent systems elevated pHi from 3.6 to 4.2 and 4.7, respectively. However, when pHi was manipulated to 4.0 in the presence or absence of glutamate, only cultures challenged in the presence of glutamate survived, indicating that a physiological parameter aside from pHi was also important. Measurements of $\delta$$\Psi$ indicated that amino acid-dependent acid resistance systems help convert membrane potential from an inside negative to inside positive charge, an established acidophile strategy used to survive extreme acidic environments. Thus, reversing $\delta$$\Psi$ may be a more important acid resistance strategy than maintaining a specific pHi value.},

AdiC is a representative member of the amino acid-polyamine- organocation (APC) superfamily of membrane transporters. The structure of substrate-free AdiC revealed a homodimeric assembly, with each protomer containing 12 transmembrane segments and existing in an outward-open conformation. The overall folding of AdiC is similar to that of the Na +-coupled symporters. Despite these advances, it remains unclear how the substrate (arginine or agmatine) is recognized and transported by AdiC. Here we report the crystal structure of an E. coli AdiC variant bound to Arg at 3.0 {\AA}resolution. The positively charged Arg is enclosed in an acidic binding chamber, with the head groups of Arg hydrogen-bonded to main chain atoms of AdiC and the aliphatic portion of Arg stacked by hydrophobic side chains of highly conserved residues. Arg binding induces pronounced structural rearrangement in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) and, to a lesser extent, TM2 and TM10, resulting in an occluded conformation. Structural analysis identified three potential gates, involving four aromatic residues and Glu 208, which may work in concert to differentially regulate the upload and release of Arg and Agm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {For successful colonization of the mammalian host, orally acquired bacteria must overcome the extreme acidic stress (pH < 2.5) encountered during transit through the host stomach. The glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) system is by far the most potent acid resistance system in commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactococcus lactis. GDAR requires the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GadB), an intracellular PLP-dependent enzyme which performs a proton-consuming decarboxylation reaction, and of the cognate antiporter (GadC), which performs the glutamatein/g-aminobutyrateout (GABA) electrogenic antiport. Herein we review recent findings on the structural determinants responsible for pH-dependent intracellular activation of E. coli GadB and GadC. A survey of genomes of bacteria (pathogenic and non-pathogenic), having in common the ability to colonize or to transit through the host gut, shows that the gadB and gadC genes frequently lie next or near each other. This gene arrangement is likely to be important to ensure timely co-regulation of the decarboxylase and the antiporter. Besides the involvement in acid resistance, GABA production and release were found to occur at very high levels in lactic acid bacteria originally isolated from traditionally fermented foods, supporting the evidence that GABA-enriched foods possess health-promoting properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Transporters of the amino acid, polyamine and organocation (APC) superfamily play essential roles in cell redox balance, cancer, and aminoacidurias. The bacterial L-arginine/agmatine antiporter, AdiC, is the main APC structural paradigm and shares the "5 + 5 inverted repeat" fold found in other families like the Na+-coupled neurotransmitter transporters. The available AdiC crystal structures capture two states of its transport cycle: the open-to-out apo and the outward-facing Arg +-bound occluded. However, the role of Arg+ during the transition between these two states remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure at 3.0 {\AA} resolution of an Arg+-bound AdiC mutant (N101A) in the open-to-out conformation, completing the picture of the major conformational states during the transport cycle of the 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold-transporters. The N101A structure is an intermediate state between the previous known AdiC conformations. The Arg+-guanidinium group in the current structure presents high mobility and delocalization, hampering substrate occlusion and resulting in a low translocation rate. Further analysis supports that proper coordination of this group with residues Asn101 and Trp293 is required to transit to the occluded state, providing the first clues on the molecular mechanism of substrate-induced fit in a 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold-transporter. The pseudosymmetry found between repeats in AdiC, and in all fold-related transporters, restraints the conformational changes, in particular the transmembrane helices rearrangements, which occur during the transport cycle. In AdiC these movements take place away from the dimer interface, explaining the independent functioning of each subunit.},

The LeuT fold is characterized by an internal twofold structural pseudosymmetry. The transport cycle of some members of each of these families is dependent on a sodium gradient across the membrane, whereas in some others the role of sodium is mimicked by proton. We report on the identification of common structure-dynamics elements of the transporters with LeuT fold, which are recognizable in the conformational transitions related to function. The findings from comparative computational modeling and simulation studies of LeuT, and ApcT from the amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporter family define the intramolecular mechanisms by which Na+ binding couples to the transport process, and single out the lead/active role of TM1a in the transition to inwardopen conformation. These mechanistic insights are derived in the context of collaborative investigations of LeuT dynamics with both single-molecule fluorescence and simulations that have produced excellent agreement of the dynamic details, and are found to be generalizable across the transporter families and to transcend sequence and motif similarities. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Pathogenic enterobacteria need to survive the extreme acidity of the stomach to successfully colonize the human gut. Enteric bacteria circumvent the gastric acid barrier by activating extreme acidresistance responses, such as the arginine-dependent acid resistance system. In this response, L-arginine is decarboxylated to agmatine, thereby consuming one proton from the cytoplasm. In Escherichia coli, the L-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC facilitates the export of agmatine in exchange of L-arginine, thus providing substrates for further removal of protons from the cytoplasm and balancing the intracellular pH. We have solved the crystal structures of wild-type AdiC in the presence and absence of the substrate agmatine at 2.6-{\AA} and 2.2-{\AA} resolution, respectively. The high-resolution structures made possible the identification of crucial water molecules in the substrate-binding sites, unveiling their functional roles for agmatine release and structure stabilization, which was further corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. Structural analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis and the scintillation proximity radioligand binding assay improved our understanding of substrate binding and specificity of the wild-type L-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC. Finally, we present a potential mechanism for conformational changes of the AdiC transport cycle involved in the release of agmatine into the periplasmic space of E. coli.},

abstract = {Background. Genome analysis indicated that the new species Brucella microti possesses a potentially functional glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system involved in extreme acid resistance in several foodborne bacteria. The contribution of this system in adaptation of B. microti to an acidic environment, including the intracellular vacuole and stomach, was investigated. Results. B. microti was GAD positive and able to export its product, $\gamma$-aminobutyrate, to the extracellular medium. The resistance of B. microti to acid stress (pH 2.5) was glutamate dependent. Mutants affected in the GAD system lost this resistance, demonstrating its direct involvement in survival under these conditions. The reciprocal heterologous complementation of mutants with the GAD systems of Escherichia coli or B. microti confirmed conserved functions in both bacterial species. A gad mutant was not attenuated during infection of macrophages, where Brucella resides in an acidified vacuole at a pH of 4-4.5 during the early phase of macrophage infection, but GAD contributed to the survival of B. microti in a murine model following oral infection. Conclusions. This work provides first evidence that the GAD system might play an essential role in the resistance of an environment-borne, pathogenic Brucella species to extreme acid shock and during passage through the host stomach following oral infection. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.

abstract = {It is well established that the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system is central to the survival of Listeria monocytogenes at low pH, both in acidic foods and within the mammalian stomach. The accepted model proposes that under acidic conditions extracellular glutamate is transported into the cell in exchange for an intracellular $\gamma$-aminobutyrate (GABA1). The glutamate is then decarboxylated to GABA1, a reaction that consumes a proton, thereby helping to prevent acidification of the cytoplasm. In this study, we show that glutamate supplementation had no influence on either growth rate at pH 5.0 or survival at pH 2.5 when L. monocytogenes 10403S was grown in a chemically defined medium (DM), In response to acidification, cells grown in DM failed to efflux GABA, even when glutamate was added to the medium. In contrast, in brain heart infusion (BHI), the same strain produced significant extracellular GABA (GABAe) in response to acidification. In addition, high levels Of GABAi (>80 mM) were found in the cytoplasm in response to low pH in both growth media. Medium-swap and medium-mixing experiments revealed that the GABA efflux apparatus was nonfunctional in DM, even when glutamate was present. It was also found that the GadT2D2 antiporter/decarboxylase system was transcribed poorly in DM-grown cultures while overexpression of gadDlTl and gadD3 occurred in response to pH 3.5. Interestingly, BHI-grown cells did not respond with upregulation of any of the GAD system genes when challenged at pH 3.5. The accumulation of GABAi in cells grown in DM in the absence of extracellular glutamate indicates that intracellular glutamate is the source of the GABA1. These results demonstrate that GABA production can be uncoupled from GABA efflux, a finding that alters the way we should view the operation of bacterial GAD systems.

abstract = {Driven by the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis, ATP-binding cassette transporters alternate between inward- and outward-facing conformations, allowing vectorial movement of substrates. Conflicting models have been proposed to describe the conformational motion underlying this switch in access of the transport pathway. One model, based on three crystal structures of the lipid flippase MsbA, envisions a large-amplitude motion that disengages the nucleotide-binding domains and repacks the transmembrane helices. To test this model and place the crystal structures in a mechanistic context, we use spin labeling and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to define the nature and amplitude of MsbA conformational change during ATP hydrolysis cycle. For this purpose, spin labels were introduced at sites selected to provide a distinctive pattern of distance changes unique to the crystallographic transformation. Distance changes in liposomes, induced by the transition from nucleotide-free MsbA to the highest energy intermediate, fit a simple pattern whereby residues on the cytoplasmic side undergo 20-30Â {\AA} closing motion while a 7- to 10-{\AA} opening motion is observed on the extracellular side. The transmembrane helices undergo relative movement to create the outward opening consistent with that implied by the crystal structures. Double electron-electron resonance distance distributions reveal asymmetric backbone flexibility on the two sides of the transporter that correlates with asymmetric opening of the substrate-binding chamber. Together with extensive accessibility analysis, our results suggest that these structures capture features of the motion that couples ATP energy expenditure to work, providing a framework for the mechanism of substrate transport. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {What conformations do protein molecules populate in solution? Crystallography provides a high-resolution description of protein structure in the crystal environment, while NMR describes structure in solution but using less data. NMR structures display more variability, but is this because crystal contacts are absent or because of fewer data constraints? Here we report unexpected insight into this issue obtained through analysis of detailed protein energy landscapes generated by large-scale, native-enhanced sampling of conformational space with Rosetta@home for 111 protein domains. In the absence of tightly associating binding partners or ligands, the lowest-energy Rosetta models were nearly all < 2.5 {\AA} C$\alpha$RMSD from the experimental structure; this result demonstrates that structure prediction accuracy for globular proteins is limited mainly by the ability to sample close to the native structure. While the lowest-energy models are similar to deposited structures, they are not identical; the largest deviations are most often in regions involved in ligand, quaternary, or crystal contacts. For ligand binding proteins, the low energy models may resemble the apo structures, and for oligomeric proteins, the monomeric assembly intermediates. The deviations between the low energy models and crystal structures largely disappear when landscapes are computed in the context of the crystal lattice or multimer. The computed low-energy ensembles, with tight crystal-structure-like packing in the core, but more NMR-structure-like variability in loops, may in some cases resemble the native state ensembles of proteins better than individual crystal or NMR structures, and can suggest experimentally testable hypotheses relating alternative states and structural heterogeneity to function. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

CaiT belongs to the family of betaine/carnitine/choline transporters (BCCT), which are mostly Na1 or H1 dependent, where as Ec CaiTis Na+ and H + independent2.The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na+-dependent transporters LeuT3 and BetP4, but in CaiT a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na+ ion to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na+-independent transport. Both CaiT structures show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism5. Ec CaiT contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of Pm CaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with Hill coefficients up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. We propose a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy is increasingly applied to spin-labeled membrane proteins. However, after reconstitution into liposomes, spin labels often exhibit a much faster transversal relaxation (Tm) than in detergent micelles, thus limiting application of the method in lipid bilayers. In this study, the main reasons for enhanced transversal relaxation in phospholipid membranes were investigated systematically by use of spin-labeled derivatives of stearic acid and phosphatidylcholine as well as spin-labeled derivatives of the channel-forming peptide gramicidin A under the conditions typically employed for PELDOR distance measurements. Our results clearly show that dephasing due to instantaneous diffusion that depends on dipolar interaction among electron spins is an important contributor to the fast echo decay in cases of high local concentrations of spin labels in membranes. The main difference between spin labels in detergent micelles and membranes is their local concentration. Consequently, avoiding spin clustering and suppressing instantaneous diffusion is the key step for maximizing PELDOR sensitivity in lipid membranes. Even though proton spin diffusion is an important relaxation mechanism, only in samples of low local concentrations does deuteration of acyl chains and buffer significantly prolong Tm. In these cases, values of up to 7 $\mu$s have been achieved. Furthermore, our study revealed that membrane composition and labeling position in the membrane can also affect Tm, either by promoting the segregation of spin-labeled species or by altering their exposure to matrix protons. Effects of other experimental parameters including temperature (<50 K), presence of oxygen, and cryoprotectant type are negligible under our experimental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

The crystal structure of BetP revealed an overall fold of two inverted structurally related repeats (LeuT-fold) that BetP shares with other sequence-unrelated Na +-coupled symporters. Numerous structures of LeuT-fold transporters in distinct conformational states have contributed substantially to our understanding of the alternating access mechanism of transport. Nevertheless, coupling of substrate and co-transported ion fluxes has not been structurally corroborated to the same extent. We converted BetP by a single-point mutation-glycine to aspartate-into an H +-coupled choline-specific transporter and solved the crystal structure of this mutant in complex with choline. The structure of BetP-G153D demonstrates a new inward-facing open conformation for BetP. Choline binding to a location close to the second, low-affinity sodium-binding site (Na2) of LeuT-fold transporters is facilitated by the introduced aspartate.

In the pseudo two-dimensional environment of proteoliposomes, a steep intermolecular background shapes DEER signals leading to long accumulation times, complicating data analysis and reducing the maximal measurable distances from 70 {\AA} down to â¼40-50 {\AA}. To eliminate these limitations, we took advantage of the homogeneity and monodispersity of a class of discoidal nanoscale phospholipid bilayers in conjunction with the micromolar DEER sensitivity at Q-band (34 GHz) microwave frequency. Spin-labeled mutants of the ABC transporter MsbA were functionally reconstituted at a ratio of one functional dimer per nanoscale apolipoprotein-bound bilayer (NABB). DEER echo intensities from NABB-reconstituted MsbA have linear baselines reflecting a three-dimensional spatial distribution. This results in an order-of-magnitude higher sensitivity at Q-band relative to proteoliposomes and restores the maximal observable distance effectively increasing experimental throughput.

abstract = {The nucleobase-cation-symport-1 (NCS1) transporters are essential components of salvage pathways for nucleobases and related metabolites. Here, we report the 2.85-angstrom resolution structure of the NCS1 benzyl-hydantoin transporter, Mhp1, from Microbacterium liquefaciens. Mhp1 contains 12 transmembrane helices, 10 of which are arranged in two inverted repeats of five helices. The structures of the outward-facing open and substrate-bound occluded conformations were solved, showing how the outward-facing cavity closes upon binding of substrate. Comparisons with the leucine transporter LeuTAa and the galactose transporter vSGLT reveal that the outward-and inward-facing cavities are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the membrane. The reciprocal opening and closing of these cavities is synchronized by the inverted repeat helices 3 and 8, providing the structural basis of the alternating access model for membrane transport.},

abstract = {Osmoregulated transporters sense intracellular osmotic pressure and respond to hyperosmotic stress by accumulation of osmolytes to restore normal hydration levels. Here we report the determination of the X-ray structure of a member of the family of betaine/choline/carnitine transporters, the Na+-coupled symporter BetP from Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is a highly effective osmoregulated uptake system for glycine betaine. Glycine betaine is bound in a tryptophan box occluded from both sides of the membrane with aromatic side chains lining the transport pathway. BetP has the same overall fold as three unrelated Na+-coupled symporters. Whereas these are crystallized in either the outward-facing or the inward-facing conformation, the BetP structure reveals a unique intermediate conformation in the Na+-coupled transport cycle. The trimeric architecture of BetP and the break in three-fold symmetry by the osmosensing C-terminal helices suggest a regulatory mechanism of Na+-coupled osmolyte transport to counteract osmotic stress. {\textcopyright}2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

BetP adjusts its transport activity by sensing the cytoplasmic K + concentration as a measure for hyperosmotic stress via the osmosensing carboxy-terminal domain. BetP needs to be in a trimeric state for communication between individual protomers through several intratrimeric interaction sites. Recently, crystal structures of inward-facing BetP trimers have contributed to our understanding of activity regulation on a molecular level. Here we report new crystal structures, which reveal two conformationally asymmetric BetP trimers, capturing among them three distinct transport states. We observe a total of four new conformations at once: an outward-open apo and an outward-occluded apo state, and two closed transition states - one in complex with betaine and one substrate-free. On the basis of these new structures, we identified local and global conformational changes in BetP that underlie the molecular transport mechanism, which partially resemble structural changes observed in other sodium-coupled LeuT-like fold transporters, but show differences we attribute to the osmolytic nature of betaine, the exclusive substrate specificity and the regulatory properties of BetP. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {An approach to find transition pathways in complex systems is presented. The method, which is related to the string method in collective variables of Maragliano et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 125, 024106), is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. It consists of refining a putative transition path in the multidimensional space supported by a set of collective variables using the average dynamic drift of those variables. This drift is estimated on-the-fly via swarms of short unbiased trajectories started at different points along the path. Successive iterations of this algorithm, which can be naturally distributed over many computer nodes with negligible interprocessor communication, refine an initial trial path toward the most probable transition path (MPTP) between two stable basins. The method is first tested by determining the pathway for the C7eq to C7ax transition in an all-atom model of the alanine dipeptide in vacuum, which has been studied previously with the string method in collective variables. A transition path is found with a committor distribution peaked at 1/2 near the free energy maximum, in accord with previous results. Last, the method is applied to the allosteric conformational change in the nitrogen regulatory protein C (NtrC), represented here with a two-state elastic network model. Even though more than 550 collective variables are used to describe the conformational change, the path converges rapidly. Again, the committor distribution is found to be peaked around 1/2 near the free energy maximum between the two stable states, confirming that a genuine transition state has been localized in this complex multidimensional system. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters from several protein families share a core of two five-helix inverted repeats that has become known as the LeuT fold. The known high-resolution protein structures with this fold were analyzed by structural superposition of the core transmembrane domains (TMDs). Three angle parameters derived from the mean TMD axes correlate with accessibility of the central binding site from the outside or inside. Structural transitions between distinct conformations were analyzed for four proteins in terms of changes in relative TMD arrangement and in internal conformation of TMDs. Collectively moving groups of TMDs were found to be correlated in the covariance matrix of elastic network models. The main features of the structural transitions can be reproduced with the 5 % slowest normal modes of anisotropic elastic network models. These results support the rocking bundle model for the major conformational change between the outward- and inward-facing states of the protein and point to an important role for the independently moving last TMDs of each repeat in occluding access to the central binding site. Occlusion is also supported by flexing of some individual TMDs in the collectively moving bundle and hash motifs. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract = {The determination of membrane protein (MP) structures has always trailed that of soluble proteins due to difficulties in their overexpression, reconstitution into membrane mimetics, and subsequent structure determination. The percentage of MP structures in the protein databank (PDB) has been at a constant 1-2% for the last decade. In contrast, over half of all drugs target MPs, only highlighting how little we understand about drug-specific effects in the human body. To reduce this gap, researchers have attempted to predict structural features of MPs even before the first structure was experimentally elucidated. In this review, we present current computational methods to predict MP structure, starting with secondary structure prediction, prediction of trans-membrane spans, and topology. Even though these methods generate reliable predictions, challenges such as predicting kinks or precise beginnings and ends of secondary structure elements are still waiting to be addressed. We describe recent developments in the prediction of 3D structures of both $\alpha$-helical MPs as well as $\beta$-barrels using comparative modeling techniques, de novo methods, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The increase of MP structures has (1) facilitated comparative modeling due to availability of more and better templates, and (2) improved the statistics for knowledge-based scoring functions. Moreover, de novo methods have benefited from the use of correlated mutations as restraints. Finally, we outline current advances that will likely shape the field in the forthcoming decade.},

We uncovered, at the molecular level, how the lipid headgroups shape the conformational-energy landscape of the transporter. The model emerging from our data suggests a direct interaction between lipid headgroups and a conserved motif of charged residues that control the conformational equilibrium through an interplay of electrostatic interactions within the protein. Together, our data lay the foundation for a comprehensive model of secondary multidrug transport in lipid bilayers.},

From analyses of the three structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism for the transport cycle in Mhp1.

abstract = {Computational protein design has found great success in engineering proteins for thermodynamic stability, binding specificity, or enzymatic activity in a âsingle state' design (SSD) paradigm. Multi-specificity design (MSD), on the other hand, involves considering the stability of multiple protein states simultaneously. We have developed a novel MSD algorithm, which we refer to as REstrained CONvergence in multi-specificity design (RECON). The algorithm allows each state to adopt its own sequence throughout the design process rather than enforcing a single sequence on all states. Convergence to a single sequence is encouraged through an incrementally increasing convergence restraint for corresponding positions. Compared to MSD algorithms that enforce (constrain) an identical sequence on all states the energy landscape is simplified, which accelerates the search drastically. As a result, RECON can readily be used in simulations with a flexible protein backbone. We have benchmarked RECON on two design tasks. First, we designed antibodies derived from a common germline gene against their diverse targets to assess recovery of the germline, polyspecific sequence. Second, we design âpromiscuousâ, polyspecific proteins against all binding partners and measure recovery of the native sequence. We show that RECON is able to efficiently recover native-like, biologically relevant sequences in this diverse set of protein complexes.},

To streamline the incorporation of diverse constraints, we developed the Broker: an extension of the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite that can express a wide range of protocols using constraints by combining small, independent modules, each of which implements a different set of constraints. We demonstrate expressiveness of the Broker through several code vignettes.

In addition, direct structural studies require that transporters be extracted from the membrane with detergent, thereby precluding transport measurements because of the lack of a vectorial environment and necessitating reconstitution into proteoliposomes for activity measurements. Here, we describe a direct scintillation proximity-based radioligand-binding assay for determining transport protein function in crude cell extracts and in purified form.

These studies show that unliganded and inverse-agonist-bound $\beta$2AR exists predominantly in two inactive conformations that exchange within hundreds of microseconds. Although agonists shift the equilibrium toward a conformation capable of engaging cytoplasmic G proteins, they do so incompletely, resulting in increased conformational heterogeneity and the coexistence of inactive, intermediate, and active states. Complete transition to the active conformation requires subsequent interaction with a G protein or an intracellular G protein mimetic. These studies demonstrate a loose allosteric coupling of the agonist-binding site and G-protein-coupling interface that may generally be responsible for the complex signaling behavior observed for many GPCRs.},

Our computational tools are designed to rapidly and exhaustively enumerate all geometrically possible docking poses for an oligomeric complex, rather than generate detailed, atomic-resolution models. Experimental data, such as interatomic distance measurements, are then used to select and refine docking poses that are consistent with the experimental restraints. Our computational toolkit is designed for use with sparse data sets to generate intermediate-resolution docking models, and utilizes distance difference matrix analysis to identify further restraint measurements that will provide maximum additional structural refinement. Thus, these tools can be used to help plan optimal residue positions for probe incorporation in labor-intensive biophysical experiments such as chemical cross-linking, electron paramagnetic resonance, or F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy studies. We present benchmark results for docking the collection of all 176 heterodimer protein complexes from the ZDOCK database, as well as a protein homodimer with recently collected experimental distance restraints, to illustrate the toolkit's capabilities and performance, and to demonstrate how distance difference matrix analysis can automatically identify and prioritize additional restraint measurements that allow us to rapidly optimize docking poses. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The overwhelming positive response to this publication we received motivates us to here share the next iteration of these tutorials that feature de novo folding, comparative modeling, loop construction, protein docking, small molecule docking, and protein design. This updated and expanded set of tutorials is needed, as since 2010 Rosetta has been fully redesigned into an object-oriented protein modeling program Rosetta3. Notable improvements include a substantially improved energy function, an XML-like language termed "RosettaScripts" for flexibly specifying modeling task, new analysis tools, the addition of the TopologyBroker to control conformational sampling, and support for multiple templates in comparative modeling. Rosetta's ability to model systems with symmetric proteins, membrane proteins, noncanonical amino acids, and RNA has also been greatly expanded and improved.},

abstract = {A simulated continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of a nitroxide spin label can be obtained from the Fourier transform of a free induction decay. It has been previously shown that the free induction decay can be calculated by solving the time-dependent stochastic Liouville equation for a set of Brownian trajectories defining the rotational dynamics of the label. In this work, a quaternion-based Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed to generate Brownian trajectories describing the global rotational diffusion of a spin-labeled protein. Also, molecular dynamics simulations of two spin-labeled mutants of T4 lysozyme, T4L F153R1, and T4L K65R1 have been used to generate trajectories describing the internal dynamics of the protein and the local dynamics of the spin-label side chain. Trajectories from the molecular dynamics simulations combined with trajectories describing the global rotational diffusion of the protein are used to account for all of the dynamics of a spin-labeled protein. Spectra calculated from these combined trajectories correspond well to the experimental spectra for the buried site T4L F153R1 and the helix surface site T4L K65R1. This work provides a framework to further explore the modeling of the dynamics of the spin-label side chain in the wide variety of labeling environments encountered in site-directed spin labeling studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The signaling apparatus that controls bacterial chemotaxis is composed of a core complex containing chemoreceptors, the histidine autokinase CheA, and the coupling protein CheW. Site-specific spin labeling and pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS) have been applied to investigate the structure of a soluble ternary complex formed by Thermotoga maritima CheA (TmCheA), CheW, and receptor signaling domains. Thirty-five symmetric spin-label sites (SLSs) were engineered into the five domains of the CheA dimer and CheW to provide distance restraints within the CheA:CheW complex in the absence and presence of a soluble receptor that inhibits kinase activity (Tm14). Additional PDS restraints among spin-labeled CheA, CheW, and an engineered single-chain receptor labeled at six different sites allow docking of the receptor structure relative to the CheA:CheW complex. Disulfide cross-linking between selectively incorporated Cys residues finds two pairs of positions that provide further constraints within the ternary complex: one involving Tm14 and CheW and another involving Tm14 and CheA. The derived structure of the ternary complex indicates a primary site of interaction between CheW and Tm14 that agrees well with previous biochemical and genetic data for transmembrane chemoreceptors. The PDS distance distributions are most consistent with only one CheW directly engaging one dimeric Tm14. The CheA dimerization domain (P3) aligns roughly antiparallel to the receptor-conserved signaling tip but does not interact strongly with it. The angle of the receptor axis with respect to P3 and the CheW-binding P5 domains is bound by two limits differing by â¼20Â°. In one limit, Tm14 aligns roughly along P3 and may interact to some extent with the hinge region near the P3 hairpin loop. In the other limit, Tm14 tilts to interact with the P5 domain of the opposite subunit in an interface that mimics that observed with the P5 homologue CheW. The time domain ESR data can be simulated from the model only if orientational variability is introduced for the P5 and, especially, P3 domains. The Tm14 tip also binds beside one of the CheA kinase domains (P4); however, in both bound and unbound states, P4 samples a broad range of distributions that are only minimally affected by Tm14 binding. The CheA P1 domains that contain the substrate histidine are also broadly distributed in space under all conditions. In the context of the hexagonal lattice formed by trimeric transmembrane chemoreceptors, the PDS structure is best accommodated with the P3 domain in the center of a honeycomb edge. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

We employ Markov state models to identify hidden conformations and explore their role in determining TEM's specificity. We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique, called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts TEM specificity by accounting for conformational heterogeneity. Using our MSMs, we identify hidden states whose populations correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models' prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced $\omega$-loop flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in drug and protein design.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is a useful tool to obtain information about the environment of specific residues. One of its applications is to investigate membrane protein topology based on the accessibility of the spin label, with the assumption that the position of the spin label in the membrane is close to that of the native residue. This assumption is valid in proteins with well-ordered structures, but could be problematic in small peptides because the labeling may cause a perturbation that is large enough to change local interactions between the peptide and the membrane. To quantitatively characterize such effects, we have simulated the association of a 25-amino-acid peptide, MARCKS-ED, to membranes with and without spin labels. Our simulations show that the depths of spin labels are â¼6-17 {\AA} deeper than the unlabeled charged and polar residues in the wild-type. When the hydrophobic residue Phe is labeled, however, the spin-label depth is close to that of the native residue as well as the experimental value. Our study suggests that one should be cautious in interpretation of spin label data when charged and polar residues in small peptides are labeled.},

Despite recent progress in structure determination of these transporters, the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the work of substrate translocation remains undefined. Here, we have investigated the conformational cycle of BmrCD, a representative of the heterodimer family of ABC exporters that have an intrinsically impaired nucleotide binding site. We measured distances between pairs of spin labels monitoring the movement of the nucleotide binding (NBD) and transmembrane domains (TMD). The results expose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These findings provide direct evidence of divergence in the mechanism of ABC exporters.},

abstract = {The Anthracis repressor (AntR) is a Mn(II)-activated DNA binding protein that is involved in the regulation of Mn(II) homeostasis in Bacillus anthracis. AntR is structurally and functionally homologous to Mn(II)-activated repressor from Bacillus subtillis (MntR). Our studies on AntR focus on metal-regulated activation of the protein. Line shape analysis of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra showed that metal binding resulted in a general reduction of backbone dynamics and that there were no further changes in backbone motion upon DNA binding. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) pulsed EPR spectroscopy was used to measure distances between nitroxide spin labels strategically placed in dimeric AntR. The DEER data were analyzed assuming Gaussian distributions for discrete populations of spins. A structural model for AntR was built from homology to MntR, and the experimentally measured distances were simulated to distinguish between spin label and backbone motions. Together with the computational analysis, the DEER results for apo-AntR indicated relatively narrow conformational distributions for backbone residues at the dimer interface and near the metal binding site. No significant changes were observed on these sites in the presence of metal or DNA. On the other hand, the distribution of the conformers and the distances between the putative DNA binding helices decreased upon metal binding. These results suggest that the DNA binding region of AntR shows large amplitude backbone motions in the absence of metal, which may preclude sequence-specific binding to promoter sites. Metal binding narrows the range of conformations accessible in this region and shortens the mean distance between the DNA binding helices, probably resulting in alignment that optimizes promoter recognition and binding. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

To determine to what extent proteins with similar sequences have a common function, we focused on photosynthesis-related proteins. A protein that comes from a non-photosynthetic organism is, undoubtedly, not involved in photosynthesis.Results: We show that function diverges very rapidly: 70% of the close homologs of photosynthetic proteins come from non-photosynthetic organisms. Therefore, high sequence similarity, in most cases, is not tantamount to similar function. However, we found that many functionally similar proteins often share short sequence elements, which may correspond to a functional site and could reveal functional similarities more accurately than sequence similarity.Conclusions: These results shed light on the way biological function is conserved in evolution and may help improve large-scale analysis of protein function. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

Distances reported by the TOPP label are compared to the ones reported by the more standard MTSSL spin label, commonly employed in protein studies.

Orientational selectivity is not observed. When spin-labeled WALP24 was inserted in two representative lipid bilayers with different bilayer thickness, i.e., DMPC and POPC, the intramolecular distance reported by TOPP did not change with the bilayer environment. In contrast, the distance measured with MTSSL was strongly affected by the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid.

Unless these spin labels are flexible in such a manner that they exhibit an almost random orientation, the PELDOR signals will-apart from the interspin distance-also depend on the orientation of the spin labels. This effect needs to be considered in the analysis of PELDOR signals and can, moreover, be used to obtain additional information on the structure of the molecule under investigation. In this work, we demonstrate that the PELDOR signal can be represented as a convolution of a kernel function containing the distance distribution function and an orientation intensity function. The following strategy is proposed to obtain both functions from the experimental data. In a first step, the distance distribution function is estimated by the Tikhonov regularization, using the average over all PELDOR time traces with different frequency offsets and neglecting angular correlations of the spin labels. Second, the convolution relation is employed to determine the orientation intensity function, using again the Tikhonov regularization. Adopting small nitroxide biradical molecules as simple examples, it is shown that the approach works well and is internally consistent. Furthermore, independent molecular dynamics simulations are performed and used to calculate PELDOR signals, distance distributions, and orientational intensity functions. The calculated and experimental results are found to be in excellent overall agreement. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements on 1H nuclei have the potential to play an important role in NMR structure determination of macromolecules by providing unique long-range (10-35 {\AA}) distance information. Recent methodological advances for covalently attaching paramagnetic groups at specific sites on both proteins and nucleic acids have permitted the application of the PRE to various biological macromolecules. However, because artificially introduced paramagnetic groups are exposed to solvent and linked to the macromolecule by several freely rotatable bonds, they are intrinsically flexible. This renders conventional back-calculation of the 1H-PRE using a single-point representation inaccurate, thereby severely limiting the utility of the 1H-PRE as a tool for structure refinement. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed a theoretical framework and computational strategy with which to accurately back-calculate 1H-PREs arising from flexible paramagnetic groups attached to macromolecules. In this scheme, the 1H-PRE is calculated using a modified Solomon-Bloembergen equation incorporating a "model-free" formalism, based on a multiple-structure representation of the paramagnetic group in simulated annealing calculations. The ensemble approach for 1H-PRE back-calculation was examined using several SRY/DNA complexes incorporating dT-EDTA-Mn2+ at three distinct sites in the DNA, permitting a large data set comprising 435 experimental backbone and side-chain 1H-PREs to be obtained in a straightforward manner from 2D through-bond correlation experiments. Calculations employing complete cross-validation demonstrate that the ensemble representation provides a means to accurately utilize backbone and side-chain 1H-PRE data arising from a flexible paramagnetic group in structure refinement. The results of 1H-PRE based refinement, in conjunction with previously obtained NMR restraints, indicate that significant gains in accuracy can be readily obtained. This is particularly significant in the case of macromolecular complexes where intermolecular translational restraints derived from nuclear Overhauser enhancement data may be limited.},

abstract = {The principal bottleneck in protein structure prediction is the refinement of models from lower accuracies to the resolution observed by experiment. We developed a novel constraints-based refinement method that identifies a high number of accurate input constraints from initial models and rebuilds them using restrained torsion angle dynamics (rTAD). We previously created a Bayesian statistics-based residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF) to discriminate native-like models by measuring the probability of accuracy for atom type distances within a given model. Here, we exploit RAPDF to score (i.e., filter) constraints from initial predictions that may or may not be close to a native-like state, obtain consensus of top scoring constraints amongst five initial models, and compile sets with no redundant residue pair constraints. We find that this method consistently produces a large and highly accurate set of distance constraints from which to build refinement models. We further optimize the balance between accuracy and coverage of constraints by producing multiple structure sets using different constraint distance cutoffs, and note that the cutoff governs spatially near versus distant effects in model generation. This complete procedure of deriving distance constraints for rTAD simulations improves the quality of initial predictions significantly in all cases evaluated by us. Our procedure represents a significant step in solving the protein structure prediction and refinement problem, by enabling the use of consensus constraints, RAPDF, and rTAD for protein structure modeling and refinement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The limitations of many structural methods have made this process challenging for most proteins.

The distances generated through this screen for the protein maltose binding protein (MBP) match distances from the crystal structure to within a few angstroms. Furthermore, energy transfer accurately detects structural changes during ligand binding. Finally, fluorescence-derived distances can be used to guide molecular simulations to find low energy states.

abstract = {We present an approach for incorporating solvent accessibility data from electron paramagnetic resonance experiments in the structural refinement of membrane proteins through restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The restraints have been parameterized from oxygen ($\Pi$O2) and nickel-ethylenediaminediacetic acid ($\Pi$NiEdda) collision frequencies, as indicators of lipid or aqueous exposed spin-label sites. These are enforced through interactions between a pseudoatom representation of the covalently attached Nitroxide spin-label and virtual "solvent" particles corresponding to O2 and NiEdda in the surrounding environment. Interactions were computed using an empirical potential function, where the parameters have been optimized to account for the different accessibilities of the spin-label pseudoatoms to the surrounding environment. This approach, "pseudoatom-driven solvent accessibility refinement", was validated by refolding distorted conformations of the Streptomyces lividans potassium channel (KcsA), corresponding to a range of 2-30 {\AA} root mean-square deviations away from the native structure. Molecular dynamics simulations based on up to 58 electron paramagnetic resonance restraints derived from spin-label mutants were able to converge toward the native structure within 1-3 {\AA} root mean-square deviations with minimal computational cost. The use of energy-based ranking and structure similarity clustering as selection criteria helped in the convergence and identification of correctly folded structures from a large number of simulations. This approach can be applied to a variety of integral membrane protein systems, regardless of oligomeric state, and should be particularly useful in calculating conformational changes from a known reference crystal structure. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

The interpretation of these experiments is based on the assumptions that the spin label does not affect the peptide configuration and that it has a fixed orientation and distance with respect to the protein backbone. Here, the validity of these assumptions is examined through implicit membrane molecular dynamics simulations of the influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptide that has been labeled with methanethiosulfonate spin label. We find that the methanethiosulfonate spin label can occasionally induce peptide orientations that differ from those adopted by the wild-type peptide. Furthermore, the spin-label resides, on average, several {\AA}ngstroms deeper in the membrane than the corresponding backbone C$\alpha$-atom even at sites pointing toward the solvent.

abstract = {Current distance measurements between spin-labels on multimeric protonated proteins using double electronâelectron resonance (DEER) EPR spectroscopy are generally limited to the 15â60 {\AA} range. Here we show how DEER experiments can be extended to dipolar evolution times of ca. 80 $\mu$s, permitting distances up to 170 {\AA} to be accessed in multimeric proteins. The method relies on sparse spin-labeling, supplemented by deuteration of protein and solvent, to minimize the deleterious impact of multispin effects and substantially increase the apparent spin-label phase memory relaxation time, complemented by high sensitivity afforded by measurements at Q-band. We demonstrate the approach using the tetradecameric molecular machine GroEL as an example. Two engineered surface-exposed mutants, R268C and E315C, are used to measure pairwise distance distributions with mean values ranging from 20 to 100 {\AA} and from 30 to 160 {\AA}, respectively, both within and between the two heptameric rings of GroEL. The measured distance distributions are consistent with the known crystal structure of apo GroEL. The methodology presented here should significantly expand the use of DEER for the structural characterization of conformational changes in higher order oligomers.},

@article{Exchange2015,
abstract = {ConspectusProtein structures are not static but sample different conformations over a range of amplitudes and time scales. These fluctuations may involve relatively small changes in bond angles or quite large rearrangements in secondary structure and tertiary fold. The equilibrium between discrete structural substates on the microsecond to millisecond time scale is sometimes termed conformational exchange. Protein dynamics and conformational exchange are believed to provide the basis for many important activities, such as protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, enzymatic activity and protein allostery; however, for many proteins, the dynamics and conformational exchange that lead to function are poorly defined.Spectroscopic methods, such as NMR, are among the most important methods to explore protein dynamics and conformational exchange; however, they are difficult to implement in some systems and with some types of exchange events. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) is an EPR based approach that is particularly well-suited to high molecular-weight systems such as membrane proteins. Because of the relatively fast time scale for EPR spectroscopy, it is an excellent method to examine exchange. Conformations that are in exchange are captured as distinct populations in the EPR spectrum, and this feature when combined with the use of methods that can shift the free energy of conformational substates allows one to identify regions of proteins that are in dynamic exchange. In addition, modern pulse EPR methods have the ability to examine conformational heterogeneity, resolve discrete protein states, and identify the substates in exchange.Protein crystallography has provided high-resolution models for a number of membrane proteins; but because of conformational exchange, these models do not always reflect the structures that are present when the protein is in a native bilayer environment. In the case of the Escherichia coli vitamin B12 transporter, BtuB, the energy coupling segment of this protein undergoes a substrate-dependent unfolding, which acts to couple this outer-membrane protein to the inner-membrane protein TonB. EPR spectroscopy demonstrates that the energy coupling segment is in equilibrium between ordered and disordered states, and that substrate binding shifts this equilibrium to favor an unfolded state. However, in crystal structures of BtuB, this segment is resolved and folded within the protein, and neither the presence of this equilibrium nor the substrate-induced change is revealed. This is a result of the solute environment and the crystal lattice, both of which act to stabilize one conformational substate of the transporter.Using SDSL, it can be shown that conformational exchange is present in other regions of BtuB and in other members of this transporter family. Conformational exchange has also been examined in systems such as the plasma membrane SNARE protein, syntaxin 1A, where dynamics are controlled by regulatory proteins such as munc18. Regulating the microsecond to millisecond time scale dynamics in the neuronal SNAREs is likely to be a key feature that regulates assembly of the SNAREs and neurotransmitter release.},

abstract = {A complete description of the pathways and mechanisms of protein folding requires a detailed structural and energetic characterization of the conformational ensemble along the entire folding reaction coordinate. Simulations can provide this level of insight for small proteins. In contrast, with the exception of hydrogen exchange, which does not monitor folding directly, experimental studies of protein folding have not yielded such structural and energetic detail. NMR can provide residue specific atomic level structural information, but its implementation in protein folding studies using chemical or temperature perturbation is problematic. Here we present a highly detailed structural and energetic map of the entire folding landscape of the leucine-rich repeat protein, pp32 (Anp32), obtained by combining pressure-dependent site-specific 1H-15N HSQC data with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The results obtained using this equilibrium approach demonstrate that the main barrier to folding of pp32 is quite broad and lies near the unfolded state, with structure apparent only in the C-terminal region. Significant deviation from two-state unfolding under pressure reveals an intermediate on the folded side of the main barrier in which the N-terminal region is disordered. A nonlinear temperature dependence of the population of this intermediate suggests a large heat capacity change associated with its formation. The combination of pressure, which favors the population of folding intermediates relative to chemical denaturants; NMR, which allows their observation; and constrained structure-based simulations yield unparalleled insight into protein folding mechanisms.},

abstract = {We consider the state-of-the-art capabilities and future perspectives of electron-spin triangulation by high-field/high-frequency dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques designed for determining the three-dimensional structure of large supra-molecular complexes dissolved in disordered solids. These techniques combine double site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) with orientation-resolving pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy. In particular, we appraise the prospects of angular triangulation, which extends the more familiar distance triangulation. As a model case for spin-labeled proteins, the three-dimensional structures of two nitroxide biradicals with rather stiff bridging blocks and deuterated nitroxide headgroups have been derived. To this end we applied 95 GHz high-field electron dipolar EPR spectroscopy with the microwave pulse-sequence configurations for PELDOR and relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement (RIDME). Various specific spectroscopic strategies are discussed to overcome the problems of overlapping spectra of the chemically identical nitroxide labels when attached to macromolecular systems. We conclude that due to the high detection sensitivity and spectral resolution the combination of SDSL with high-field RIDME/PELDOR stands out as an extremely powerful tool for 3D structure determination of large disordered systems. The approach compares favorably with other structure-determining magnetic-resonance methods. This holds true both for stable and transient radical-pair states. Angular constraints are provided in addition to distance constraints obtained for the same sample. Thereby, the number of necessary distance constraints is strongly reduced. Since each measurement of a distance constraint requires an additional doubly spin-labeled sample, the reduction of necessary distance constraints is another appealing aspect of orientation-resolving EPR spin triangulation for protein structure determination. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {DEER (double electron-electron resonance) is a powerful pulsed ESR (electron spin resonance) technique allowing the determination of distance histograms between pairs of nitroxide spin-labels linked to a protein in a native-like solution environment. However, exploiting the huge amount of information provided by ESR/DEER histograms to refine structural models is extremely challenging. In this study, a restrained ensemble (RE) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methodology is developed to address this issue. In RE simulation, the spin-spin distance distribution histograms calculated from a multiple-copy MD simulation are enforced, via a global ensemble-based energy restraint, to match those obtained from ESR/DEER experiments. The RE simulation is applied to 51 ESR/DEER distance histogram data from spin-labels inserted at 37 different positions in T4 lysozyme (T4L). The rotamer population distribution along the five dihedral angles connecting the nitroxide ring to the protein backbone is determined and shown to be consistent with available information from X-ray crystallography. For the purpose of structural refinement, the concept of a simplified nitroxide dummy spin-label is designed and parametrized on the basis of these all-atom RE simulations with explicit solvent. It is demonstrated that RE simulations with the dummy nitroxide spin-labels imposing the ESR/DEER experimental distance distribution data are able to systematically correct and refine a series of distorted T4L structures, while simple harmonic distance restraints are unsuccessful. This computationally efficient approach allows experimental restraints from DEER experiments to be incorporated into RE simulations for efficient structural refinement. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This aspect is particularly evident for disordered proteins, which constitute perhaps one-third of the human proteome. Therefore, structural ensembles often offer more useful representations of proteins than individual conformations. Here, we describe how the well-established principles of protein structure determination should be extended to the case of protein structural ensembles determination. These principles concern primarily how to deal with conformationally heterogeneous states, and with experimental measurements that are averaged over such states and affected by a variety of errors. We first review the growing literature of recent methods that combine experimental and computational information to model structural ensembles, highlighting their similarities and differences. We then address some conceptual problems in the determination of structural ensembles and define future goals towards the establishment of objective criteria for the comparison, validation, visualization and dissemination of such ensembles.},

Several groups have devoted their efforts in trying to create quantitative, reliable and accurate protocols for extracting such information from averaged data. We analyze here different approaches, discussing strengths and weaknesses of each. All approaches can roughly be clustered into two groups: Those satisfying the maximum entropy principle and those recovering ensembles composed of a restricted number of molecular conformations. In the first case, the solution focuses on the features that are common to all the infinite solutions satisfying the experimental data; in the second case, the reconstructed ensemble shows the conformational regions where a large probability can be placed. The upper limits for conformational probabilities (MaxOcc) can also be calculated. We also give an overview of the mainstream experimental observables, with considerations on the assumptions underlying their usage.},

abstract = {The conformational landscape of HIV-1 protease (PR) can be experimentally characterized by pulsed-EPR double electron-electron resonance (DEER). For this characterization, nitroxide spin labels are attached to an engineered cysteine residue in the flap region of HIV-1 PR. DEER distance measurements from spin-labels contained within each flap of the homodimer provide a detailed description of the conformational sampling of apo-enzyme as well as induced conformational shifts as a function of inhibitor binding. The distance distribution profiles are further interpreted in terms of a conformational ensemble scheme that consists of four unique states termed "curled/tucked", "closed", "semi-open" and "wide-open" conformations. Reported here are the DEER results for a drug-resistant variant clinical isolate sequence, V6, in the presence of FDA approved protease inhibitors (PIs) as well as a non-hydrolyzable substrate mimic, CaP2. Results are interpreted in the context of the current understanding of the relationship between conformational sampling, drug resistance, and kinetic efficiency of HIV-1PR as derived from previous DEER and kinetic data for a series of HIV-1PR constructs that contain drug-pressure selected mutations or natural polymorphisms. Specifically, these collective results support the notion that inhibitor-induced closure of the flaps correlates with inhibitor efficiency and drug resistance. This body of work also suggests DEER as a tool for studying conformational sampling in flexible enzymes as it relates to function.},

In this study, Spa15 alone and in complex with IpgB1 has been studied by double electron electron resonance, an experiment that gives distance information showing the spacial separation of attached spin labels. This distance is explained by determining the crystal structure of the spin-labeled Spa15 where labels are seen to be buried in hydrophobic pockets.

Structural alignments between LeuT and vSGLT reveal that the crystallographically identified galactose-binding site in vSGLT is located in a more extracellular location relative to the central substrate-binding site (S1) in LeuT. Our computational analyses suggest the existence of an additional galactose-binding site in vSGLT that aligns to the S1 site of LeuT. Radiolabeled galactose saturation binding experiments indicate that, like LeuT, vSGLT can simultaneously bind two substrate molecules under equilibrium conditions. Mutating key residues in the individual substrate-binding sites reduced the molar substrate-toprotein binding stoichiometry to â¼1. In addition, the related and more experimentally tractable SSS member PutP (the Na+/proline transporter) also exhibits a binding stoichiometry of 2. Targeting residues in the proposed sites with mutations results in the reduction of the binding stoichiometry and is accompanied by severely impaired translocation of proline. Our data suggest that substrate transport by SSS members requires both substrate-binding sites, thereby implying that SSSs and neurotransmitter-sodium symporters share common mechanistic elements in substrate transport.},

Whereas the core transmembrane segments (TMs) of SSSs share high structural similarity with other transporters of LeuT-like fold, TM1 does not correspond to any TM in those structural homologs and was only resolved for the backbone atoms in the initial vSGLT structure (Protein Data Bank code 3DH4). To assess the role of TM1 in Na+-coupled substrate symport by the SSSs, here we have studied the role of a conserved residue in TM1 by computational modeling in conjunction with radiotracer transport and binding studies. Based on our sequence alignment and much topological data for homologous PutP, the Na+/proline transporter, we have simulated a series of vSGLT models with shifted TM1 residue assignments. We show that in two converged vSGLT models that retained the original TM1 backbone conformation, a conserved residue, Tyr-19, is associated with the Na+ binding interaction network. In silico and in vitro mutagenesis of homologous Tyr-14 in PutP revealed the involvement of this conserved residue in Na+-dependent substrate binding and transport. Thus, our combined computational and experimental data provide the first clues about the importance of a conserved residue in TM1, a unique TM in the proteins with LeuT-like fold, in the Na+-coupled symport mechanism of SSSs. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Further analysis of the trajectories and close structural examination, in particular, comparison of the Na+-binding sites of vSGLT and LeuT, strongly indicates that the crystal structure of vSGLT actually represents an ion-releasing state of the transporter.

abstract = {LeuT-like fold Na-dependent secondary active transporters form a large family of integral membrane proteins that transport various substrates against their concentration gradient across lipid membranes, using the free energy stored in the downhill concentration gradient of sodium ions. These transporters play an active role in synaptic transmission, the delivery of key nutrients, and the maintenance of osmotic pressure inside the cell. It is generally believed that binding of an ion and/or a substrate drives the conformational dynamics of the transporter. However, the exact mechanism for converting ion binding into useful work has yet to be established. Using a multi-dimensional path sampling (string-method) followed by all-atom free energy simulations, we established the principal thermodynamic and kinetic components governing the ion-dependent conformational dynamics of a LeuT-like fold transporter, the sodium/benzyl-hydantoin symporter Mhp1, for an entire conformational cycle. We found that inward-facing and outward-facing states of Mhp1 display nearly the same free energies with an ion absent from the Na2 site conserved across the LeuT-like fold transporters. The barrier separating an apo-state from inward-facing or outward-facing states of the transporter is very low, suggesting stochastic gating in the absence of ion/substrate bound. In contrast, the binding of a Na2 ion shifts the free energy stabilizing the outward-facing state and promoting substrate binding. Our results indicate that ion binding to the Na2 site may also play a key role in the intracellular thin gate dynamics modulation by altering its interactions with the transmembrane helix 5 (TM5). The Potential of Mean Force (PMF) computations for a substrate entrance displays two energy minima that correspond to the locations of the main binding site S1 and proposed allosteric S2 binding site. However, it was found that substrate's binds to the site S1 â¼5 kcal/mol more favorable than that to the site S2 for all studied bound combinations of ions and a substrate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Zhao and Noskov.},

Even though several transporters sharing this core have been structurally determined over the past few years, vSGLT is the only one crystallized in the substrate-bound inward-facing conformation so far. In this study, we report the first insight into the dynamics and coordination of the galactose (Gal) and proposed Na+ ion in vSGLT using a series of molecular dynamics simulations with a total time of about 0.1 $\mu$s. Our study reveals new residues, not observed in the crystal structure, which closely interact with the Na+ ion or the substrate for extended times, and shows that in the crystallized conformation, a Na+ ion placed at the site equivalent to Na2 in LeuT can escape into the intracellular (IC) space in the absence of external forces. We have identified the highly conserved Asp189 as a likely binding residue on the pathway of Na+ into the IC cavity. The release of Gal, on the other hand, requires the rotation of the side chain of the inner hydrophobic gate, Tyr263, without a significant change in vSGLT backbone conformation. Our simulations further show that the crystal structure represents but one accessible binding pose of Gal and Na+ among an ensemble of microstates, and that the Gal undergoes versatile alternate interactions at the binding pocket. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Because of the continuous development of more efficient algorithms harvesting ever-expanding computational resources, and the emergence of more advanced and novel theories and methodologies, the scope of computational studies has expanded significantly over the past decade, now including much larger molecular systems and far more complex molecular phenomena. Among the various computer modeling techniques, the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and related techniques has particularly drawn attention in biomolecular research, because of the ability of the method to describe the dynamical nature of the molecular systems and thereby to provide a more realistic representation, which is often needed for understanding fundamental molecular properties. The method has proven to be remarkably successful in capturing molecular events and structural transitions highly relevant to the function and/or physicochemical properties of biomolecular systems. Herein, after a brief introduction to the method of MD, we use a number of membrane transport proteins studied in our laboratory as examples to showcase the scope and applicability of the method and its power in characterizing molecular motions of various magnitudes and time scales that are involved in the function of this important class of membrane proteins. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Significant advances have been made in recent years in characterizing neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family structure and function. Yet, many time-resolved events and intermediates that control the various stages of transport cycle remain to be elucidated. Whether NSSs harbor one or two sites for binding their substrates (neurotransmitters or amino acids), and what the role of the secondary site S2 is, if any, are still unresolved. Using molecular modeling and simulations for LeuT, a bacterial NSS, we present a comprehensive account of substrate-binding and -stabilization events, and subsequently triggered interactions leading to substrate (alanine) release. LeuT instantaneous conformation as it reconfigures from substrate-receiving (outward-facing) to -releasing (inward-facing) state appears to be a determinant of its affinity to bind substrate at site S2. In the outward-facing state, S1 robustly binds alanine and regulates subsequent redistribution of interactions to trigger extracellular gate closure; whereas S2 is only a transient binding site. The substrate-binding affinity at S2 increases in an intermediate close to inward-facing state. LeuT harbors the two substrate-binding sites, and small displacements of second substrate near S2 are observed to induce concerted small translocations in the substrate bound to primary site S1, although complete release requires collective structural rearrangements that fully expose the intracellular vestibule to the cytoplasm. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Crystal structures of wild-type and mutants of LeuT have been interpreted as conformational states in the coupled transport cycle. However, the mechanistic identities inferred from these structures have not been validated, and the ligand-dependent conformational equilibrium of LeuT has not been defined. Here, we used distance measurements between spin-label pairs to elucidate Na +-and leucine-dependent conformational changes on the intracellular and extracellular sides of the transporter. The results identify structural motifs that underlie the isomerization of LeuT between outward-facing, inward-facing and occluded states. The conformational changes reported here present a dynamic picture of the alternating-access mechanism of LeuT and NSSs that is different from the inferences reached from currently available structural models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract = {Complex networks of interacting residues and microdomains in the structures of biomolecular systems underlie the reliable propagation of information from an input signal, such as the concentration of a ligand, to sites that generate the appropriate output signal, such as enzymatic activity. This information transduction often carries the signal across relatively large distances at the molecular scale in a form of allostery that is essential for the physiological functions performed by biomolecules. While allosteric behaviors have been documented from experiments and computation, the mechanism of this form of allostery proved difficult to identify at the molecular level. Here, we introduce a novel analysis framework, called N-body Information Theory (NbIT) analysis, which is based on information theory and uses measures of configurational entropy in a biomolecular system to identify microdomains and individual residues that act as (i)-channels for long-distance information sharing between functional sites, and (ii)-coordinators that organize dynamics within functional sites. Application of the new method to molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the occluded state of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT identifies a channel of allosteric coupling between the functionally important intracellular gate and the substrate binding sites known to modulate it. NbIT analysis is shown also to differentiate residues involved primarily in stabilizing the functional sites, from those that contribute to allosteric couplings between sites. NbIT analysis of MD data thus reveals rigorous mechanistic elements of allostery underlying the dynamics of biomolecular systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 LeVine, Weinstein.},

Transporters of different functional families with little sequence similarity have repeatedly been found to exhibit similar folds, exemplified by the MFS, LeuT, and NhaA folds. Observations of multiple conformational states of the same transporter, represented by the LeuT superfamily members Mhp1, AdiC, vSGLT, and LeuT, led to proposals that structural changes are associated with substrate binding and transport. Despite recent biochemical and structural advances, our understanding of substrate recognition and energy coupling is rather preliminary. This review focuses on the common folds and shared transport mechanisms of secondary active transporters. Available structural information generally supports the alternating access model for substrate transport, with variations and extensions made by emerging structural, biochemical, and computational evidence.},

abstract = {Employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the pathway and mechanism of substrate unbinding from the inward-facing state of the Na +-coupled galactose transporter, vSGLT, have been investigated. During a 200-ns equilibrium simulation, repeated spontaneous unbinding events of the substrate from its binding site have been observed. In contrast to the previously proposed gating role of a tyrosine residue (Y263), the unbinding mechanism captured in the present equilibrium simulation does not rely on the displacement and/or rotation of this side chain. Rather, the unbinding involves an initial lateral displacement of the substrate out of the binding site which allows the substrate to completely emerge from the region covered by the side chain of Y263 without any noticeable conformational changes of the latter. Starting with the snapshots taken from this equilibrium simulation with the substrate outside the binding site, steered MD (SMD) simulations were then used to probe the translocation of the substrate along the remaining of the release pathway within the protein's lumen and to characterize the nature of protein-substrate interactions involved in the process. Combining the results of the equilibrium and SMD simulations, we provide a description of the full translocation pathway for the substrate release from the binding site into the cytoplasm. Residues E68, N142, T431, and N267 facilitate the initial substrate's displacement out of the binding site, while the translocation of the substrate along the remainder of the exit pathway formed between TM6 and TM8 is facilitated by H-bond interactions between the substrate and a series of conserved, polar residues (Y138, N267, R273, S365, S368, N371, S372, and T375). The observed molecular events indicate that no gating is required for the release of the substrate from the crystallographically captured structure of the inward-facing state of SGLT, suggesting that this conformation might represent an open, rather than occluded, state of the transporter.

abstract = {It is well accepted that cotransporters facilitate water movement by two independent mechanisms: osmotic flow through a water channel in the protein and flow driven by ion/substrate cotransport. However, the molecular mechanism of transport-linked water flow is controversial. Some researchers believe that it occurs via cotransport, in which water is pumped along with the transported cargo, while others believe that flow is osmotic in response to an increase in intracellular osmolarity. In this letter, we report the results of a 200-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the sodium-dependent galactose cotransporter vSGLT. Our simulation shows that a significant number of water molecules cross the protein through the sugar-binding site in the presence as well as the absence of galactose, and 70-80 water molecules accompany galactose as it moves from the binding site into the intracellular space. During this event, the majority of water molecules in the pathway are unable to diffuse around the galactose, resulting in water in the inner half of the transporter being pushed into the intracellular space and replaced by extracellular water. Thus, our simulation supports the notion that cotransporters act as both passive water channels and active water pumps with the transported substrate acting as a piston to rectify the motion of water. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Although water permeation across cell membranes occurs through several types of membrane proteins, the only permeation mechanism resolved at atomic scale is that through aquaporins. Crystallization of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium-galactose transporter (vSGLT) allows investigation of putative water permeation pathways through both vSGLT and the homologous human Na-glucose cotransporter (hSGLT1) using computational methods. Grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations were used to stably insert water molecules in both proteins, showing the presence of a water-filled pathway composed of â¼100 water molecules. This provides a structural basis for passive water permeation that is difficult to reconcile with the water cotransport hypothesis. Potential-of-mean-force calculations of water going through the crystal structure of vSGLT shows a single barrier of 7.7 kCal mol -1, in agreement with previously published experimental data for cotransporters of the SGLT family. Electrophysiological and volumetric experiments performed on hSGLT1-expressing Xenopus oocytes showed that the passive permeation pathway exists in different conformational states. In particular, experimental conditions that aim to mimic the conformation of the crystal structure displayed passive water permeability. These results provide groundwork for understanding the structural basis of cotransporter water permeability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Asp187 in the Na+/proline transporter of Escherichia coli (PutP) is conserved within the Na+/solute cotransporter family. Information on the role of this residue has been gained by amino acid substitution analysis. PutP with Glu, Asn, or Cys in place of Asp187 catalyzed Na+-coupled proline uptake at 75%, 25%, and 1.5%, respectively, of the V(max) of PutP-wild-type while the apparent K(m) for proline was only slightly altered. Importantly, acetylation or amidoacetylation of an engineered transporter containing a single Cys at position 187 stimulated proline uptake. Strikingly, PutP-D187C exhibited high-affinity proline binding even at very low Na+ concentrations (2 $\mu$M) while proline binding to PutP-wild-type, -D187E, and -D187N was strictly dependent on the Na+ concentration. The apparent independence of proline binding from the Na+ concentration can at least partially be attributed to an enhanced Na+ affinity of PutP-D187C. In addition, reaction of PutP containing a single Cys at position 187 with N-ethylmaleimide was inhibited by Na+ but not by Li+ or proline. The results indicate that electrostatic interactions of the amino acid side chain at position 187 in PutP with other parts of the transporter and/or the coupling ion are crucial for active proline transport. It is suggested that Asp187 is located close to the pathway of the coupling ion through the membrane and may be involved in the release of Na+ on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.},

abstract = {Asp187 and Gln190 were predicted as conserved and closely located at the Na + binding site in a topology and homology model structure of Na +/proline symporter (PutP) of Escherichia coli. The replacement of Asp187 with Ala or Leu did not affect proline transport activity; whereas, change to Gln abolished the active transport. The binding affinity for Na + or proline of these mutants was similar to that of wild-type (WT) PutP. This result indicates Asp187 to be responsible for active transport of proline without affecting the binding. Replacement of Gln190 with Ala, Asn, Asp, Leu and Glu had no effect on transport or binding, suggesting that it may not have a role in the transport. However, in the negative D187Q mutant, a second mutation, of Gln190 to Glu or Leu, restored 46 or 7 of the transport activity of WT, respectively, while mutation to Ala, Asn or Asp had no effect. Thus, side chain at position 190 has a crucial role in suppressing the functional defect of the D187Q mutant. We conclude that Asp187 is responsible for transport activity instead of coupling-ion binding by constituting the translocation pathway of the ion and Gln190 provides a suppressing mutation site to regain PutP functional activity. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Serotonin transporter (SERT) catalyzes reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and is a target for antidepressant drugs and psychostimulants. It is a member of a large family of neurotransmitter and amino acid transporters. A recent study using site-directed cysteine modification identified a helical region of the transporter with high accessibility to the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the high resolution structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic homologue, showed that the residues corresponding to this helical region are part of the fifth transmembrane domain. The accessibility of these positions is now shown to depend on conformational changes corresponding to interconversion of SERT between two forms that face the extracellular medium and the cytoplasm, respectively. Binding of the extracellular inhibitor cocaine decreased accessibility at these positions, whereas 5-HT, the transported substrate, increased it. The effect of 5-HT required the simultaneous presence of Na + and Cl-, which are transported into the cell together (symported) with 5-HT. In light of the LeuT structure, these results begin to define the pathway through which 5-HT diffuses between its binding site and the cytoplasm. They also confirm a prediction of the alternating access model for transport, namely, that all symported substrates must bind together before translocation. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Monoamine transporters are responsible for termination of synaptic signaling and are involved in depression, control of appetite, and anxiety amongst other neurological processes. Despite extensive efforts, the structures of the monoamine transporters and the transport mechanism of ions and substrates are still largely unknown. Structural knowledge of the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) is much awaited for understanding the mechanistic details of substrate translocation and binding of antidepressants and drugs of abuse. The publication of the crystal structure of the homologous leucine transporter has resulted in homology models of the monoamine transporters. Here we present extended molecular dynamics simulations of an experimentally supported homology model of hSERT with and without the natural substrate yielding a total of more than 1.5 $\mu$s of simulation of the protein dimer. The simulations reveal a transition of hSERT from an outward-facing occluded conformation to an inward-facing conformation in a one-substrate-bound state. Simulations with a second substrate in the proposed symport effector site did not lead to conformational changes associated with translocation. The central substrate binding site becomes fully exposed to the cytoplasm leaving both the Na +-ion in the Na2-site and the substrate in direct contact with the cytoplasm through water interactions. The simulations reveal how sodium is released and show indications of early events of substrate transport. The notion that ion dissociation from the Na2-site drives translocation is supported by experimental studies of a Na2-site mutant. Transmembrane helices (TMs) 1 and 6 are identified as the helices involved in the largest movements during transport. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kolds{\o} et al.},

abstract = {Crystal structures of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter transporters, show a molecule of bound substrate that is essentially exposed to the extracellular space but occluded from the cytoplasm. Thus, there must exist an alternate conformation for LeuT in which the substrate is accessible to the cytoplasm and a corresponding mechanism that switches accessibility from one side of the membrane to the other. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic accessibility pathway of the alternate conformation in a mammalian serotonin transporter (SERT) (a member of the same transporter family as LeuT). We also propose a model for the cytoplasmic-facing state that exploits the internal pseudosymmetry observed in the crystal structure. LeuT contains two structurally similar repeats (TMs1-5 and TMs 6-10) that are inverted with respect to the plane of the membrane. The conformational differences between them result in the formation of the extracellular pathway. Our model for the cytoplasm-facing state exchanges the conformations of the two repeats and thus exposes the substrate and ion-binding sites to the cytoplasm. The conformational change that connects the two states primarily involves the tilting of a 4-helix bundle composed of transmembrane helices 1, 2, 6, and 7. Switching the tilt angle of this bundle is essentially equivalent to switching the conformation of the two repeats. Extensive mutagenesis of SERT and accessibility measurements, using cysteine reagents, are accommodated by our model. These observations may be of relevance to other transporter families, many of which contain internal inverted repeats. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Recent progress in crystallographic studies of sodium-coupled secondary transporters has revealed striking similarities in the structural organization of ion and solute binding. Previous reports suggested that the Na2 sodium binding site in the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) leucine transporter (LeuT) is conserved across sodium/proton coupled secondary transporters of many distantly related families. This site is implicated in the conformational dynamics controlled by the binding and release of both translocated solute and ion(s) through a mechanism that largely remains unknown. In this study, we used extensive equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, potential of mean force (PMF) computations, and quasi-harmonic analysis of the LeuT transporter with and without sodium ion bound at the Na2 site to delineate the role of this site in the conformational dynamics of the protein. PMF computations show that in presence of the sodium ion in Na2 the conserved T354 residue is locked into a single rotameric state in contrast to two degenerate states available in the absence of ion in Na2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest the formation of a stable water wire from the cytoplasm to the Na2 site in the occluded state. It is plausible that local hydration plays an important role in transport cycle facilitating release of the ion from Na2. An unbinding of the ion from the Na2 site leads to a tightening of the extracellular thin gates and a destabilization of the intracellular thin gate and thus may promote an unbinding of the cotransported substrate. The study lends additional support to the hypothesis that one of the main drivers in the transport cycle of Na-coupled secondary transporters is the binding of the Na2 ion that controls dynamical equilibrium between an inward-facing to an outward-facing conformation. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Previous studies revealed Tyr95 and Ile172 as important for citalopram binding, however, the overall orientation of the ligands in the binding site and the protein-ligand interaction points remain unknown. The binding of S- and R-citalopram to a human serotonin transporter homology model are herein examined via docking simulations including induced fit effects. For a better description of the formal charges of the ligand when bound inside the protein, polarization effects of the protein were included by additional quantum-polarized ligand docking calculations, where ligand charges are evaluated using QM/MM calculations. By this approach a much clearer picture emerged of the positions of the functional groups of citalopram. The two enantiomers are predicted to bind in the substrate binding pocket with opposite orientations of their aromatic groups. The predicted binding modes are experimentally validated using human wild type and 15 serotonin transporter mutants and 13 optically pure citalopram analogues. Important protein-ligand interaction points were identified validating one binding model for each enantiomer.

abstract = {Antidepressants targeting Na+/Cl--coupled neurotransmitter uptake define a key therapeutic strategy to treat clinical depression and neuropathic pain. However, identifying the molecular interactions that underlie the pharmacological activity of these transport inhibitors, and thus the mechanism by which the inhibitors lead to increased synaptic neurotransmitter levels, has proven elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter at 3.0 {\AA} resolution bound to the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline. The transporter is locked in an outward-open conformation with nortriptyline wedged between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6 and 8, blocking the transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing conformation. Although the overall structure of the dopamine transporter is similar to that of its prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix 12 halfway across the membrane bilayer, a latch-like carboxy-terminal helix that caps the cytoplasmic gate, and a cholesterol molecule wedged within a groove formed by transmembrane helices 1a, 5 and 7. Taken together, the dopamine transporter structure reveals the molecular basis for antidepressant action on sodium-coupled neurotransmitter symporters and elucidates critical elements of eukaryotic transporter structure and modulation by lipids, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanism and regulation of neurotransmitter uptake at chemical synapses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The Na+/solute symporter family comprises more than 400 members of pro- and eukaryotic origin. Using the Na+/proline transporter PutP of Escherichia coli as a model, the role of two conserved residues, Ser-340 and Thr-341, is investigated to obtain insights into the mechanism of transport catalyzed by members of this family. Substitution of these amino acids alters the transport kinetics of cells and proteoliposomes containing the PutP variants significantly. In particular, the apparent affinities for Na+ and Li+ are reduced by 2 orders of magnitude or more. Also proline binding is affected, albeit to a lesser extent than ion binding. Thereby, the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 341 is essential for high affinity ligand binding. Furthermore, Cys placed at position 340 or 341 reacts with sulfhydryl reagents of different polarity, indicating accessibility from the water phase. In addition, Cys cross-linking suggests proximity of the residues to other amino acids previously shown to be crucial for ligand binding. For these reasons it is suggested that Ser-340 and Thr-341 are located in a ligand translocation pathway. Furthermore, it is proposed that the side chain of Thr-341 directly participates in Na+ binding. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Molecular modeling and structure-activity relationship studies were performed to propose a model for binding of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) to the human serotonin transporter (hSERT). Homology models were constructed using the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue, the leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus, as the template and three slightly different sequence alignments. Induced fit docking of 5-HT into hSERT homology models resulted in two different binding modes. Both show a salt bridge between Asp98 and the charged primary amine of 5-HT, and both have the 5-HT C6 position of the indole ring pointing toward Ala173. The difference between the two orientations of 5-HT is an enantiofacial discrimination of the indole ring, resulting in the 5-hydroxyl group of 5-HT being vicinal to either Ser438/Thr439 or Ala169/Ile172/Ala173. To assess the binding experimentally, binding affinities for 5-HT and 17 analogues toward wild type and 13 single point mutants of hSERT were measured using an approach termed paired mutant-ligand analogue complementation (PaMLAC). The proposed ligand-protein interaction was systematically examined by disrupting it through site-directed mutagenesis and reestablishing another interaction via a ligand analogue matching the mutated residue, thereby minimizing the risk of identifying indirect effects. The interactions between Asp98 and the primary amine of 5-HT and the interaction between the C6-position of 5-HT and hSERT position 173 was confirmed using PaMLAC. The measured binding affinities of various mutants and 5-HT analogues allowed for a distinction between the two proposed binding modes of 5-HT and biochemically support the model for 5-HT binding in hSERT where the 5-hydroxyl group is in close proximity to Thr439. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

To characterize structure or structural changes, experimental protocols were optimized and techniques for artifact suppression were introduced. Data analysis programs were developed, and it was realized that interpretation of the distance distributions must take into account the conformational distribution of spin labels.

Often, experimental information is only semireliable because it is uncertain, limited, or confusing in important ways. Some experiments give sparse information, some give ambiguous or nonspecific information, and others give uncertain information - where some is right, some is wrong, but we don't know which. We describe a method called Modeling Employing Limited Data (MELD) that can harness such problematic information in a physics-based, Bayesian framework for improved structure determination. We apply MELD to eight proteins of known structure for which such problematic structural data are available, including a sparse NMR dataset, two ambiguous EPR datasets, and four uncertain datasets taken from sequence evolution data. MELD gives excellent structures, indicating its promise for experimental biomolecule structure determination where only semireliable data are available.},

Here, a novel restrained-ensemble molecular dynamics simulation method is developed to incorporate the information from multiple ESR/DEER distance histograms simultaneously. Illustrative tests on three coupled spin-labels inserted in T4 lysozyme show that the method efficiently imposes the experimental distance distribution in this system. Different rotameric states of the $\chi$1 and $\chi$2 dihedrals in the spin-labels are also explored by restrained ensemble simulations. Using this method, it is hoped that experimental restraints from ESR/DEER experiments can be used to refine structural properties of biological systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The BCL::MP-Fold (BioChemical Library membrane protein fold) algorithm assembles secondary structure elements (SSEs) in the membrane using a Monte Carlo Metropolis (MCM) approach. Sampled models are evaluated using knowledge-based potential functions and agreement with the EPR data and a knowledge-based energy function. Twenty-nine membrane proteins of up to 696 residues are used to test the algorithm. The RMSD100 value of the most accurate model is better than 8 {\AA} for 27, better than 6 {\AA} for 22, and better than 4 {\AA} for 15 of the 29 proteins, demonstrating the algorithms' ability to sample the native topology.

In this study, force field parameters for the bifunctional spin-label (RX) used in EPR/DEER are parametrized and tested with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The dihedral angles connecting the C$\alpha$ atom of the backbone to the nitroxide ring moiety of the RX spin-label attached to i and i + 4 positions in a polyalanine $\alpha$-helix agree very well with those observed in the X-ray crystallography. Both RXi,i+4 and RXi,i+3 are more rigid than the monofunctional spin-label (R1) commonly used in EPR/DEER, while RXi,i+4 is more rigid and causes less distortion in a protein backbone than RXi,i+3. Simplified dummy spin-label models with a single effective particle representing the RXi,i+3 and RXi,i+4 are also developed and parametrized from the all-atom simulations. MD simulations with dummy spin-labels (MDDS) provide distance distributions that can be directly compared to distance distributions obtained from EPR/DEER to rapidly assess if a hypothetical three-dimensional (3D) structural model is consistent with experiment. The dummy spin-labels can also be used in the restrained-ensemble MD (re-MD) simulations to carry out structural refinement of 3D models. Applications of this methodology to T4 lysozyme, KCNE1, and LeuT are shown to provide important insights about their conformational dynamics.},

abstract = {The modeling of protein-protein complexes greatly benefits from the incorporation of experimental distance restraints. Pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy is one such powerful technique for obtaining long-range distance restraints in protein complexes. Measurements of the dipolar interaction between two spins placed specifically within a protein complex give information about the spin-spin separation distance. We have developed a convenient method to incorporate such long-range distance information in the modeling of protein-protein complexes that is based on rigid body refinement of the protein components with the software Crystallography and NMR System (CNS). Factors affecting convergence such as number of restraints, error allocation scheme, and number and position of spin labeling sites were investigated with real and simulated data. The use of 4 to 5 different labeling sites on each protein component was found to provide sufficient coverage for producing accuracies limited by the uncertainty in the spin-label conformation within the complex. With an asymmetric scheme of allocating this uncertainty, addition of simulated restraints revealed the importance of longer distances within a limited set of total restraints. We present two case studies: (1) refinement of the complex formed between the histidine kinase CheA and its coupling protein CheW, and (2) refinement of intra-helical separations in the protein a-synuclein bound to micelles. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

By combining 18 EPR-derived interelectron spin label distance distributions with NMR-based secondary structure definitions and bond vector restraints, interelectron distances were correlated and a set of theoretical ensemble basis populations was calculated. A minimal set of basis structures, representing the partially folded state of SLAS-bound $\alpha$S, was subsequently derived by back-calculating correlated distance distributions. A surprising variety of well-defined protein-micelle interactions was thus revealed in which the micelle is engulfed by two differently arranged antiparallel $\alpha$S helices. The methodology further provided the population ratios between dominant ensemble structural states, whereas limitation in obtainable structural resolution arose from spin label flexibility and residual uncertainties in secondary structure definitions. To advance the understanding of protein-micelle interactions, the present study concludes by showing that, in marked contrast to secondary structure stability, helix dynamics of SLAS-bound $\alpha$S correlate with the degree of protein-induced departures from free micelle dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein is known to play a causative role in Parkinson disease. Although its physiological functions are not fully understood, $\alpha$-synuclein has been shown to interact with synaptic vesicles and modulate neurotransmitter release. However, the structure of its physiologically relevant membrane-bound state remains unknown. Here we developed a site-directed spin labeling and EPR-based approach for determining the structure of $\alpha$-synuclein bound to a lipid bilayer. Continuous-wave EPR was used to assign local secondary structure and to determine the membrane immersion depth of lipid-exposed residues, whereas pulsed EPR was used to map long-range distances. The structure of $\alpha$-synuclein was built and refined by using simulated annealing molecular dynamics restrained by the immersion depths and distances. We found that $\alpha$-synuclein forms an extended, curved $\alpha$-helical structure that is over 90 aa in length. The monomeric helix has a superhelical twist similar to that of right-handed coiled-coils which, like $\alpha$-synuclein, contain 11-aa repeats, but which are soluble, oligomeric proteins (rmsd = 0.82 {\AA}). The $\alpha$-synuclein helix extends parallel to the curved membrane in a manner that allows conserved Lys and Glu residues to interact with the zwitterionic headgroups, while uncharged residues penetrate into the acyl chain region. This structural arrangement is significantly different from that of $\alpha$-synuclein in the presence of the commonly used membrane-mimetic detergent SDS, which induces the formation of two antiparallel helices. Our structural analysis emphasizes the importance of studying membrane protein structure in a bilayer environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We illustrate the method for human ubiquitin in solution and find that there is considerable conformational heterogeneity throughout the protein structure. The interior atoms of the protein are tightly packed in each individual conformation that contributes to the ensemble but their overall behaviour can be described as having a significant degree of liquid-like character.

abstract = {Long-range distance measurements based on paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) in NMR, quantification of surface water dynamics near biomacromolecules by Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and sensitivity enhancement by solid-state DNP all depend on introducing paramagnetic species into an otherwise diamagnetic NMR sample. The species can be introduced by site-directed spin labeling, which offers precise control for positioning the label in the sequence of a biopolymer. However, internal flexibility of the spin label gives rise to dynamic processes that potentially influence PRE and DNP behavior and leads to a spatial distribution of the electron spin even in solid samples. Internal dynamics of spin labels and their static conformational distributions have been studied mainly by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, with a large body of results for the most widely applied methanethiosulfonate spin label MTSL. These results are critically discussed in a unifying picture based on rotameric states of the group that carries the spin label. Deficiencies in our current understanding of dynamics and conformations of spin labeled groups and of their influence on NMR observables are highlighted and directions for further research suggested.

abstract = {An increasingly used parameter in structural biology is the measurement of distances between spin labels bound to a protein. One limitation to these measurements is the unknown position of the spin label relative to the protein backbone. To overcome this drawback, we introduce a rotamer library of the methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL) into the protein modeling program Rosetta. Spin label rotamers were derived from conformations observed in crystal structures of spin labeled T4 lysozyme and previously published molecular dynamics simulations. Rosetta's ability to accurately recover spin label conformations and EPR measured distance distributions was evaluated against 19 experimentally determined MTSSL labeled structures of T4 lysozyme and the membrane protein LeuT and 73 distance distributions from T4 lysozyme and the membrane protein MsbA. For a site in the core of T4 lysozyme, the correct spin label conformation (Î§1 and Î§2) is recovered in 99.8% of trials. In surface positions 53% of the trajectories agree with crystallized conformations in Î§1 and Î§2. This level of recovery is on par with Rosetta performance for the 20 natural amino acids. In addition, Rosetta predicts the distance between two spin labels with a mean error of 4.4 {\AA}. The width of the experimental distance distribution, which reflects the flexibility of the two spin labels, is predicted with a mean error of 1.3 {\AA}. RosettaEPR makes full-atom spin label modeling available to a wide scientific community in conjunction with the powerful suite of modeling methods within Rosetta. {\textcopyright} 2013 Alexander et al.},

abstract = {In site directed spin labeling, a nitroxide side chain is introduced at a selected site in a protein; the most commonly used is a disulfide-linked side chain designated R1. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of R1, and the interspin distance between pairs of R1 residues as determined by dipolar EPR spectroscopy, encode a wealth of information on the protein structure and dynamics. However, extracting this information requires structural and dynamical models of the R1 side chain, that is, the favored rotamers, the intraresidue interactions that stabilize them, and the internal modes of motion. X-ray crystal structures of R1 in proteins have revealed a set of preferred rotamers in the crystal lattice. To identify the intraresidue interactions that stabilize particular rotamers of R1 in the absence of interactions with nearby side chains in a helix, and to evaluate models for the internal motion of the side chain, quantum mechanical calculations were performed on a relevant fragment of R1 in a 10-residue $\alpha$-helix. Relative rotamer energies were determined in the gas phase, and solvation energies were estimated from a continuum solvent model that includes both electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions. The results identified preferred rotamers that are in agreement with the X-ray crystallographic studies. The rotamers are apparently stabilized by intraresidue sulfur-backbone interactions, suggesting that the preferred rotamers may be the same at all solvent-exposed helix sites. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Measurement of distances between spin labels using electron paramagnetic resonance with the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique is an important method for evaluation of biomolecular structures. Computation of interlabel distances is of value for experimental planning, validation of known structures using DEER-measured distances, and determination of theoretical data for comparison with experiment. This requires steps of building labels at two defined sites on proteins, DNA or RNA; calculation of allowable label conformers based on rotation around torsional angles; computation of pairwise interlabel distances on a per conformer basis; and calculation of an average distance between the two label ensembles. We have described and validated two programs for this purpose: NASNOX, which permits computation of distances between R5 labels on DNA or RNA; and PRONOX, which similarly computes distances between R1 labels on proteins. However, these programs are limited to a specific single label and single target types. Therefore, we have developed a program, which we refer to as ALLNOX (Addition of Labels and Linkers), which permits addition of any label to any site on any target. The main principle in the program is to break the molecular system into a "label," a "linker," and a "target." The user can upload a "label" with any chemistry, define a "linker" based on a SMILES-like string, and then define the "target" site. The flexibility of ALLNOX facilitates theoretical evaluation of labels prior to synthesis and accommodates evaluation of experimental data in biochemical complexes containing multiple molecular types.},

The direct translation of the experimental distances into structural information is however often impaired by the intrinsic flexibility of the spin labelled side chains. Different algorithms exist that predict the approximate conformation of the spin label either by using pre-computed rotamer libraries of the labelled side chain (rotamer approach) or by simply determining its accessible volume (accessible volume approach). Surprisingly, comparisons with many experimental distances have shown that both approaches deliver the same distance prediction accuracy of about 3 {\AA}. Results: Here, instead of comparing predicted and experimental distances, we test the ability of both approaches to predict the actual conformations of spin labels found in a new high-resolution crystal structure of spin labelled azurin (T21R1). Inside the crystal, the label is found in two very different environments which serve as a challenging test for the in silico approaches. Conclusions: Our results illustrate why simple and more sophisticated programs lead to the same prediciton error. Thus, a more precise treatment of the complete environment of the label and also its interactions with the environment will be needed to increase the accuracy of in silico spin labelling algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Florin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Their insertion is assisted by membrane proteins of the Omp85-TpsB superfamily. These proteins are composed of a C-terminal ??-barrel and a different number of N-terminal POTRA domains, three in the case of cyanobacterial Omp85. Based on structural studies of Omp85 proteins, including the five POTRA-domain-containing BamA protein of Escherichia coli, it is predicted that anaP2 and anaP3 bear a fixed orientation, whereas anaP1 and anaP2 are connected via a flexible hinge. We challenged this proposal by investigating the conformational space of the N-terminal POTRA domains of Omp85 from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 using pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR, or DEER) spectroscopy. The pronounced dipolar oscillations observed for most of the double spin-labeled positions indicate a rather rigid orientation of the POTRA domains in frozen liquid solution. Based on the PELDOR distance data, structure refinement of the POTRA domains was performed taking two different approaches: 1) treating the individual POTRA domains as rigid bodies; and 2) using an all-atom refinement of the structure. Both refinement approaches yielded ensembles of model structures that are more restricted compared to the conformational ensemble obtained by molecular dynamics simulations, with only a slightly different orientation of N-terminal POTRA domains anaP1 and anaP2 compared with the x-ray structure. The results are discussed in the context of the native environment of the POTRA domains in the periplasm.},

abstract = {A tether-in-a-cone model is developed for the simulation of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of dipolar coupled nitroxide spin labels attached to tethers statically disordered within cones of variable halfwidth. In this model, the nitroxides adopt a range of interprobe distances and orientations. The aim is to develop tools for determining both the distance distribution and the relative orientation of the labels from experimental spectra. Simulations demonstrate the sensitivity of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra to the orientation of the cones as a function of cone halfwidth and other parameters. For small cone halfwidths (<â¼40Â°), simulated spectra are strongly dependent on the relative orientation of the cones. For larger cone halfwidths, spectra become independent of cone orientation. Tether-in-a-cone model simulations are analyzed using a convolution approach based on Fourier transforms. Spectra obtained by the Fourier convolution method more closely fit the tether-in-a-cone simulations as the halfwidth of the cone increases. The Fourier convolution method gives a reasonable estimate of the correct average distance, though the distance distribution obtained can be significantly distorted. Finally, the tether-in-a-cone model is successfully used to analyze experimental spectra from T4 lysozyme. These results demonstrate the utility of the model and highlight directions for further development. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

To further investigate the role of the Gly-Gly pairs, 11 double-replacement mutants were constructed for each pair at positions 46 (helix II) and 262 (helix VIII). Replacement with Ala or Ser results in decreased but significant transport activity, while replacements with Thr, Val, Leu, Asn, Gln, Tyr, Trp, Glu, or Lys exhibit very little or no transport. Remarkably, however, the double mutants bind galactoside with affinities 10-20-fold higher than that of the pseudo-WT or WT LacY. Moreover, site-directed alkylation of a periplasmic Cys replacement indicates that the periplasmic cavity becomes readily accessible in the double-replacement mutants. Molecular dynamics simulations with the WT and double-Leu mutant in the inward-open/outward-closed conformation provide support for this interpretation.},

abstract = {Structure determination remains a challenge for many biologically important proteins. In particular, proteins that adopt multiple conformations often evade crystallization in all biologically relevant states. Although computational de novo protein folding approaches often sample biologically relevant conformations, the selection of the most accurate model for different functional states remains a formidable challenge, in particular, for proteins with more than about 150 residues. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can obtain limited structural information for proteins in well-defined biological states and thereby assist in selecting biologically relevant conformations. The present study demonstrates that de novo folding methods are able to accurately sample the folds of 192-residue long soluble monomeric Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). The tertiary structures of the monomeric and homodimeric forms of BAX were predicted using the primary structure as well as 25 and 11 EPR distance restraints, respectively. The predicted models were subsequently compared to respective NMR/X-ray structures of BAX. EPR restraints improve the protein-size normalized root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD100) of the most accurate models with respect to the NMR/crystal structure from 5.9 {\AA} to 3.9 {\AA} and from 5.7 {\AA} to 3.3 {\AA}, respectively. Additionally, the model discrimination is improved, which is demonstrated by an improvement of the enrichment from 5% to 15% and from 13% to 21%, respectively.},

abstract = {Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) is often used for the structural characterization of proteins that elude other techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). However, high-resolution structures are difficult to obtain due to uncertainty in the spin label location and sparseness of experimental data. Here, we introduce RosettaEPR, which has been designed to improve de novo high-resolution protein structure prediction using sparse SDSL-EPR distance data. The "motion-on-a-cone" spin label model is converted into a knowledge-based potential, which was implemented as a scoring term in Rosetta. RosettaEPR increased the fractions of correctly folded models (RMSDC$\alpha$<7.5. {\AA}) and models accurate at medium resolution (RMSDC$\alpha$<3.5. {\AA}) by 25%. The correlation of score and model quality increased from 0.42 when using no restraints to 0.51 when using bounded restraints and again to 0.62 when using RosettaEPR. This allowed for the selection of accurate models by score. After full-atom refinement, RosettaEPR yielded a 1.7. {\AA} model of T4-lysozyme, thus indicating that atomic detail models can be achieved by combining sparse EPR data with Rosetta. While these results indicate RosettaEPR's potential utility in high-resolution protein structure prediction, they are based on a single example. In order to affirm the method's general performance, it must be tested on a larger and more versatile dataset of proteins. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy, DEER and DQC, require frozen samples. An important issue in the biological application of this technique is how the freezing rate and concentration of cryoprotectant could possibly affect the conformation of biomacromolecule and/or spin-label. We studied in detail the effect of these experimental variables on the distance distributions obtained by DEER from a series of doubly spin-labeled T4 lysozyme mutants. We found that the rate of sample freezing affects mainly the ensemble of spin-label rotamers, but the distance maxima remain essentially unchanged. This suggests that proteins frozen in a regular manner in liquid nitrogen faithfully maintain the distance-dependent structural properties in solution. We compared the results from rapidly freeze-quenched (???100 ??s) samples to those from commonly shock-frozen (slow freeze, 1 s or longer) samples. For all the mutants studied we obtained inter-spin distance distributions, which were broader for rapidly frozen samples than for slowly frozen ones. We infer that rapid freezing trapped a larger ensemble of spin label rotamers; whereas, on the time-scale of slower freezing the protein and spin-label achieve a population showing fewer low-energy conformers. We used glycerol as a cryoprotectant in concentrations of 10% and 30% by weight. With 10% glycerol and slow freezing, we observed an increased slope of background signals, which in DEER is related to increased local spin concentration, in this case due to insufficient solvent vitrification, and therefore protein aggregation. This effect was considerably suppressed in slowly frozen samples containing 30% glycerol and rapidly frozen samples containing 10% glycerol. The assignment of bimodal distributions to tether rotamers as opposed to protein conformations is aided by comparing results using MTSL and 4-Bromo MTSL spin-labels. The latter usually produce narrower distance distributions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A hybrid protein structure determination approach combining sparse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) distance restraints and Rosetta de novo protein folding has been previously demonstrated to yield high quality models (Alexander et al. (2008)). However, widespread application of this methodology to proteins of unknown structures is hindered by the lack of a general strategy to place spin label pairs in the primary sequence. In this work, we report the development of an algorithm that optimally selects spin labeling positions for the purpose of distance measurements by EPR. For the $\alpha$-helical subdomain of T4 lysozyme (T4L), simulated restraints that maximize sequence separation between the two spin labels while simultaneously ensuring pairwise connectivity of secondary structure elements yielded vastly improved models by Rosetta folding. 54% of all these models have the correct fold compared to only 21% and 8% correctly folded models when randomly placed restraints or no restraints are used, respectively. Moreover, the improvements in model quality require a limited number of optimized restraints, which is determined by the pairwise connectivities of T4L $\alpha$-helices. The predicted improvement in Rosetta model quality was verified by experimental determination of distances between spin labels pairs selected by the algorithm. Overall, our results reinforce the rationale for the combined use of sparse EPR distance restraints and de novo folding. By alleviating the experimental bottleneck associated with restraint selection, this algorithm sets the stage for extending computational structure determination to larger, traditionally elusive protein topologies of critical structural and biochemical importance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Such information must be translated into geometric restraints to be used in computer simulations. Here, distances between spin labels are converted into distance ranges between $\beta$ carbons by using a "motion-on-a-cone" model, and a linear-correlation model links spin-label accessibility to the number of neighboring residues. This approach was tested on T4-lysozyme and $\alpha$A-crystallin with the deÂ novo structure prediction algorithm Rosetta. The results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining highly accurate, atomic-detail models from EPR data by yielding 1.0 {\AA} and 2.6 {\AA} full-atom models, respectively. Distance restraints between amino acids far apart in sequence but close in space are most valuable for structure determination.

Ensembles of models that best represent the experimental distance distributions are determined by a Monte Carlo search algorithm. As a result, predominantly open conformations are observed in the unliganded state indicating that the majority of enzyme molecules await substrate binding for the catalytic cycle. The addition of a substrate analog yields ensembles with an almost equal mixture of open and closed states. Thus, in the presence of substrate, efficient catalysis is provided by the simultaneous appearance of open conformers (binding substrate or releasing product) and closed conformers (enabling the turnover of the substrate).},

We determined the crystal structure at 2.9 angstroms of the bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), a homolog of SERT, NET, and DAT, in complex with leucine and the antidepressant desipramine. Desipramine binds at the inner end of the extracellular cavity of the transporter and is held in place by a hairpin loop and by a salt bridge. This binding site is separated from the leucine-binding site by the extracellular gate of the transporter. By directly locking the gate, desipramine prevents conformational changes and blocks substrate transport.

abstract = {Sodium-coupled transporters are ubiquitous pumps that harness pre-existing sodium gradients to catalyse the thermodynamically unfavourable uptake of essential nutrients, neurotransmitters and inorganic ions across the lipid bilayer. Dysfunction of these integral membrane proteins has been implicated in glucose/galactose malabsorption, congenital hypothyroidism, Bartter's syndrome, epilepsy, depression, autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sodium-coupled transporters are blocked by a number of therapeutically important compounds, including diuretics, anticonvulsants and antidepressants, many of which have also become indispensable tools in biochemical experiments designed to probe antagonist binding sites and to elucidate transport mechanisms. Steady-state kinetic data have revealed that both competitive and noncompetitive modes of inhibition exist. Antagonist dissociation experiments on the serotonin transporter (SERT) have also unveiled the existence of a low-affinity allosteric site that slows the dissociation of inhibitors from a separate high-affinity site. Despite these strides, atomic-level insights into inhibitor action have remained elusive. Here we screen a panel of molecules for their ability to inhibit LeuT, a prokaryotic homologue of mammalian neurotransmitter sodium symporters, and show that the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine noncompetitively inhibits substrate uptake. Cocrystal structures show that clomipramine, along with two other TCAs, binds in an extracellular-facing vestibule about 11 {\AA} above the substrate and two sodium ions, apparently stabilizing the extracellular gate in a closed conformation. Off-rate assays establish that clomipramine reduces the rate at which leucine dissociates from LeuT and reinforce our contention that this TCA inhibits LeuT by slowing substrate release. Our results represent a molecular view into noncompetitive inhibition of a sodium-coupled transporter and define principles for the rational design of new inhibitors. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

All SSRIs possess halogen atoms at specific positions, which are key determinants for the drugs' specificity for SERT. For the SERT protein, however, the structural basis of its specificity for SSRIs is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structures of LeuT, a bacterial SERT homolog, in complex with sertraline, R-fluoxetine or S-fluoxetine. The SSRI halogens all bind to exactly the same pocket within LeuT. Mutation at this halogen-binding pocket (HBP) in SERT markedly reduces the transporter's affinity for SSRIs but not for tricyclic antidepressants. Conversely, when the only nonconserved HBP residue in both norepinephrine and dopamine transporters is mutated into that found in SERT, their affinities for all the three SSRIs increase uniformly. Thus, the specificity of SERT for SSRIs is dependent largely on interaction of the drug halogens with the protein's HBP. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The crystal structure of LeuTAa, a prokaryotic NSS homolog, revealed an occluded state in which one leucine and two Na+ ions are bound, but provided limited clues to the molecular mechanism of transport. Using steered molecular dynamics simulations, we explored the substrate translocation pathway of LeuT. We identified a second substrate binding site located in the extracellular vestibule comprised of residues shown recently to participate in binding tricyclic antidepressants. Binding and flux experiments showed that the two binding sites can be occupied simultaneously. The substrate in the secondary site allosterically triggers intracellular release of Na+ and substrate from the primary site, thereby functioning as a "symport effector." Because tricyclic antidepressants bind differently to this secondary site, they do not promote substrate release from the primary site and thus act as symport uncouplers and inhibit transport. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We have constructed stable cell lines expressing transporters for dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) by transfection with cloned cDNAs. The parental LLC-PK1 cell does not express any of these neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, monoamine transport activities in each of these cell lines are due to the transfected DNA only, allowing comparison in the same background. Drug inhibition profiles for each cell line are distinct and as expected for each transporter. LLC-NET and LLC-DAT cells transported both NE and DA and both cell types exhibited a lower K(M) for DA transport than for NE transport. Analysis of V(max) data for LLC-NET cells suggests that substrate is bound to the NE transporter during the rate- limiting step(s) in transport. The cocaine analog 2-$\beta$-carbomethoxy-3$\beta$-(4- [125I]iodophenyl)tropane binds to each cell type, and is displaced by transport substrate in each case. Binding and transport measurements on parallel cell cultures allowed estimation of turnover numbers for norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin transporters. All three transporters require external Na+ and Cl-. The Na+ concentration dependence suggests that a single Na+ ion is involved in transport catalyzed by norepinephrine and serotonin transporters while more than one Na+ ion participate in transport mediated by the dopamine transporter.},

abstract = {Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) has emerged as a powerful technique for measuring long range distances and distance distributions between paramagnetic centers in biomolecules. This information can then be used to characterize functionally relevant structural and dynamic properties of biological molecules and their macromolecular assemblies. Approaches have been developed for analyzing experimental data from standard four-pulse DEER experiments to extract distance distributions. However, these methods typically use an a priori baseline correction to account for background signals. In the current work an approach is described for direct fitting of the DEER signal using a model for the distance distribution which permits a rigorous error analysis of the fitting parameters. Moreover, this approach does not require a priori background correction of the experimental data and can take into account excluded volume effects on the background signal when necessary. The global analysis of multiple DEER data sets is also demonstrated. Global analysis has the potential to provide new capabilities for extracting distance distributions and additional structural parameters in a wide range of studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {LeuT is a bacterial homologue of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family and, being the only NSS member to have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography, is a model protein for studying transporter structure and mechanism. Transport activity in LeuT was hypothesized to require structural transitions between open-to-out and occluded conformations dependent upon protein:ligand binding complementarity. Here, using crystallographic and functional analysis, we show that binding site modification produces changes in both structure and activity that are consistent with complementarity-dependent structural transitions to the occluded state. The mutation I359Q converts the activity of tryptophan from inhibitor to transportable substrate. This mutation changes the local environment of the binding site, inducing the bound tryptophan to adopt a different conformer than in the wild-type complex. Instead of trapping the transporter open, tryptophan binding now allows the formation of an occluded state. Thus, transport activity is correlated to the ability of the ligand to promote the structural transition to the occluded state, a step in the transport cycle that is dependent on protein:ligand complementarity in the central binding site. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter sodium symporters are integral membrane proteins that remove chemical transmitters from the synapse and terminate neurotransmission mediated by serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glycine and GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid). Crystal structures of the bacterial homologue, LeuT, in substrate-bound outward-occluded and competitive inhibitor-bound outward-facing states have advanced our mechanistic understanding of neurotransmitter sodium symporters but have left fundamental questions unanswered. Here we report crystal structures of LeuT mutants in complexes with conformation-specific antibody fragments in the outward-open and inward-open states. In the absence of substrate but in the presence of sodium the transporter is outward-open, illustrating how the binding of substrate closes the extracellular gate through local conformational changes: hinge-bending movements of the extracellular halves of transmembrane domains 1, 2 and 6, together with translation of extracellular loop 4. The inward-open conformation, by contrast, involves large-scale conformational changes, including a reorientation of transmembrane domains 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, a marked hinge bending of transmembrane domain 1a and occlusion of the extracellular vestibule by extracellular loop 4. These changes close the extracellular gate, open an intracellular vestibule, and largely disrupt the two sodium sites, thus providing a mechanism by which ions and substrate are released to the cytoplasm. The new structures establish a structural framework for the mechanism of neurotransmitter sodium symporters and their modulation by therapeutic and illicit substances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) couple the uptake of neurotransmitter with one or more sodium ions1-3, removing neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. NSSs are essential to the function of chemical synapses, are associated with multiple neurological diseases and disorders4, and are the targets of therapeutic and illicit drugs 5. LeuT, a prokaryotic orthologue of the NSS family, is a model transporter for understanding the relationships between molecular mechanism and atomic structure in a broad range of sodium-dependent and sodium-independent secondary transporters6-13. At present there is a controversy over whether there are one or two high-affinity substrate binding sites in LeuT. The first-reported crystal structure of LeuT, together with subsequent functional and structural studies, provided direct evidence for a single, high-affinity, centrally located substrate-binding site, defined as the S1 site 14,15. Recent binding, flux and molecular simulation studies, however, have been interpreted in terms of a model where there are two high-affinity binding sites: the central, S1, site and a second, the S2 site, located within the extracellular vestibule16. Furthermore, it was proposed that the S1 and S2 sites are allosterically coupled such that occupancy of the S2 site is required for the cytoplasmic release of substrate from the S1 site16. Here we address this controversy by performing direct measurement of substrate binding to wild-type LeuT and to S2 site mutants using isothermal titration calorimetry, equilibrium dialysis and scintillation proximity assays. In addition, we perform uptake experiments to determine whether the proposed allosteric coupling between the putative S2 site and the S1 site manifests itself in the kinetics of substrate flux. We conclude that LeuT harbours a single, centrally located, high-affinity substrate-binding site and that transport is well described by a simple, single-substrate kinetic mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) are involved in the translocation of small molecules in the periplasm. To unload, the two domains of a PBP open up, allowing the ligand to exit. However, it is not clear whether there are dynamics near the binding site which can facilitate the rapid dissociation of a ligand. To visualize such dynamics, we utilized paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR and introduced a rigid paramagnetic probe to a PBP, glutamine-binding protein (QBP) with its cognate ligand bound. A paramagnetic Cu(II) ion is sandwiched between an engineered di-histidine motif at a helix and an NTA capping molecule. The afforded paramagnetic probe is so rigid that PRE values calculated from a single structure of holo QBP largely agree with the observed values. The remaining PRE discrepancies, however, manifest dynamics of a loop in the opposite domain from the paramagnetic probe. This loop packs against the glutamine ligand in the holo QBP and undergoes fluctuations upon ligand dissociation, as assessed by steered molecular dynamics simulations. As such, the loop dynamics, occurring for a small population in nanosecond to microsecond time scale, may be related to the ligand dissociation process. The rigid paramagnetic probe described herein can be grafted to other protein systems for structure and dynamics studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Contrary to popular assumption, the rate of growth of structural data has slowed, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has not been growing exponentially since 1995. Reaching such a dramatic conclusion requires careful measurement of growth of novel structures, which can be achieved by clustering entry sequences, or by using a novel index to down-weight entries with a higher number of sequence neighbors. These measures agree, and growth rates are very similar for entire PDB files, clusters, and weighted chains. The overall sizes of Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) categories (number of families, superfamilies, and folds) appear to be directly proportional to the number of deposited PDB files. Using our weighted chain count, which is most correlated to the change in the size of each SCOP category in anytime period, shows that the rate of increase of SCOP categories is actually slowing down. This enables the final size of each of these SCOP categories to be predicted without examining or comparing protein structures. In the last 3 years, structures solved by structural genomics (SG) initiatives, especially the United States National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative, have begun to redress the slowing growth of the PDB. Structures solved by SG are 3.8 times less sequence-redundant than typical PDB structures. Since mid-2004, SG programs have contributed half the novel structures measured by weighted chain counts. Our analysis does not rely on visual inspection of coordinate sets: it is done automatically, providing an accurate, up-to-date measure of the growth of novel protein structural data. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The crystal structure of the prokaryotic NSS protein, LeuT, was recently solved at high resolution; however, the mechanistic details of regulation of the permeation pathway in this class of proteins remain unknown. Here we combine computational modeling and experimental probing in the dopamine transporter (DAT) to demonstrate the functional importance of a conserved intracellular interaction network. Our data suggest that a salt bridge between Arg-60 in the N terminus close to the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment (TM) 1 and Asp-436 at the cytoplasmic end of TM8 is stabilized by a cation-$\pi$ interaction between Arg-60 and Tyr-335 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Computational probing illustrates how the interactions may determine the flexibility of the permeation pathway, and mutagenesis within the network and results from assays of transport, as well as the state-dependent accessibility of a substituted cysteine in TM3, support the role of this network in regulating access between the substrate binding site and the intracellular milieu. The mechanism that emerges from these findings may be unique to the NSS family, where the local disruption of ionic interactions modulates the transition of the transporter between the outward- and inward-facing conformations. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical properties as well as the evolution of interactions between proteins. The Protein Data Bank represents an important source of information for such studies, because more than half of the structures are homo- or heteromeric protein complexes. Here we propose the first hierarchical classification of whole protein complexes of known 3-D structure, based on representing their fundamental structural features as a graph. This classification provides the first overview of all the complexes in the Protein Data Bank and allows nonredundant sets to be derived at different levels of detail. This reveals that between one-half and two-thirds of known structures are multimeric, depending on the level of redundancy accepted. We also analyse the structures in terms of the topological arrangement of their subunits and find that they form a small number of arrangements compared with all theoretically possible ones. This is because most complexes contain four subunits or less, and the large majority are homomeric. In addition, there is a strong tendency for symmetry in complexes, even for heteromeric complexes. Finally, through comparison of Biological Units in the Protein Data Bank with the Protein Quaternary Structure database, we identified many possible errors in quaternary structure assignments. Our classification, available as a database and Web server at http://www.3Dcomplex.org, will be a starting point for future work aimed at understanding the structure and evolution of protein complexes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Levy et al.},

abstract = {The biologically active state of many proteins requires their prior homo-oligomerisation. Such complexes are typically symmetrical, a feature that has been proposed to increase their stability and facilitate the evolution of allosteric regulation. We wished to examine the possibility that similar structures and properties could arise from genetic amplifications leading to internal symmetrical repeats. For this, we identified internal structural repeats in a nonredundant Protein Data Bank subset. While testing if repeats in proteins tend to be symmetrical, we found that about half of the large internal repeats are symmetrical, most frequently around a rotation axis of 180Â°. These repeats were most likely created by genetic amplification processes because they show significant sequence similarity. Symmetrical repeats tend to have a fixed number of copies corresponding to their rotational symmetry order, that is, two for 180Â° rotation axis, whereas asymmetrical repeats are in longer proteins and show copy number variability. When possible, we confirmed that proteins with symmetrical repeats folding as an n-mer have homologues lacking the repeat with a higher oligomerisation number corresponding to the rotation symmetry order of the repeat. Phylogenetic analyses of these protein families suggest that typically, but not always, symmetrical repeats arise in one single event from proteins that are homo-oligomers. These results suggest that oligomerisation and amplification of internal sequences can interplay in evolutionary terms because they result in functional analogues when the latter exhibit rotational symmetry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A strong propensity toward symmetric architectures has long been recognized for water-soluble proteins, and this propensity has been rationalized from an evolutionary standpoint. Proteins residing in cellular membranes, however, have traditionally been less amenable to structural studies, and thus the prevalence and significance of symmetry in this important class of molecules is not as well understood. In the past two decades, researchers have made great strides in this area, and these advances have provided exciting insights into the range of architectures adopted by membrane proteins. These structural studies have revealed a similarly strong bias toward symmetric arrangements, which were often unexpected and which occurred despite the restrictions imposed by the membrane environment on the possible symmetry groups. Moreover, membrane proteins disproportionately contain internal structural repeats resulting from duplication and fusion of smaller segments. This article discusses the types and origins of symmetry in membrane proteins and the implications of symmetry for protein function.},

abstract = {Secondary active transporters couple the free energy of the electrochemical potential of one solute to the transmembrane movement of another. As a basic mechanistic explanation for their transport function the model of alternating access was put forward more than 40 years ago, and has been supported by numerous kinetic, biochemical and biophysical studies. According to this model, the transporter exposes its substrate binding site(s) to one side of the membrane or the other during transport catalysis, requiring a substantial conformational change of the carrier protein. In the light of recent structural data for a number of secondary transport proteins, we analyze the model of alternating access in more detail, and correlate it with specific structural and chemical properties of the transporters, such as their assignment to different functional states in the catalytic cycle of the respective transporter, the definition of substrate binding sites, the type of movement of the central part of the carrier harboring the substrate binding site, as well as the impact of symmetry on fold-specific conformational changes. Besides mediating the transmembrane movement of solutes, the mechanism of secondary carriers inherently involves a mechanistic coupling of substrate flux to the electrochemical potential of co-substrate ions or solutes. Mainly because of limitations in resolution of available transporter structures, this important aspect of secondary transport cannot yet be substantiated by structural data to the same extent as the conformational change aspect. We summarize the concepts of coupling in secondary transport and discuss them in the context of the available evidence for ion binding to specific sites and the impact of the ions on the conformational state of the carrier protein, which together lead to mechanistic models for coupling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {LeuT serves as the model protein for understanding the relationships between structure, mechanism and pharmacology in neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSSs). At the present time, however, there is a vigorous debate over whether there is a single high-affinity substrate site (S1) located at the original, crystallographically determined substrate site or whether there are two high-affinity substrates sites, one at the primary or S1 site and the other at a second site (S2) located at the base of the extracellular vestibule. In an effort to address the controversy over the number of high-affinity substrate sites in LeuT, one group studied the F253A mutant of LeuT and asserted that in this mutant substrate binds exclusively to the S2 site and that 1 mM clomipramine entirely ablates substrate binding to the S2 site. Here we study the binding of substrate to the F253A mutant of LeuT using ligand binding and X-ray crystallographic methods. Both experimental methods unambiguously show that substrate binds to the S1 site of the F253A mutant and that binding is retained in the presence of 1 mM clomipramine. These studies, in combination with previous work, are consistent with a mechanism for LeuT that involves a single high-affinity substrate binding site. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

The crystal structure of the NSS homolog LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus revealed one leucine substrate in an occluded, centrally located (S1) binding site next to two Na + ions. Computational studies combined with binding and flux experiments identified a second substrate (S2) site and a molecular mechanism of Na +-substrate symport that depends upon the allosteric interaction of substrate molecules in the two high-affinity sites. Here we show that the S2 site, which has not yet been identified by crystallographic approaches, can be blocked during preparation of detergent-solubilized LeuT, thereby obscuring its crucial role in Na +-coupled symport. This finding points to the need for caution in selecting experimental environments in which the properties and mechanistic features of membrane proteins can be delineated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc.

We have used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis to capture the dynamics of LeuT in the region of the extracellular vestibule associated with the binding of Na + and leucine. The results outline the Na +-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate that exposes the primary substrate binding site and the conformational changes that occlude this binding site upon subsequent binding of the leucine substrate.

abstract = {In metabolism, available free energy is limited and must be divided across pathway steps to maintain a negative $\Delta$G throughout. For each reaction, $\Delta$G is log proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain a unified set of concentrations and $\Delta$G for each organism. In glycolysis, we find that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes associated with $\Delta$G near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite concentrations and $\Delta$G are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints.},

Two of the four underrepresented sequences (URSs) were shown to interfere with translation in vivo and in vitro. Enlarging the URS by a single amino acid resulted in increased translational inhibition. Single-molecule methods revealed stalling of translation at the entrance of the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosome, adjacent to ribosomal nucleotides A2062 and U2585. Interaction with these same ribosomal residues is involved in regulation of translation by longer, naturally occurring protein sequences. The E. coli exit tunnel has evidently evolved to minimize interaction with the exit tunnel and maximize the sequence diversity of the proteome, although allowing some interactions for regulatory purposes. Bioinformatic analysis of the human proteome revealed no underrepresented triplet sequences, possibly reflecting an absence of regulation by interaction with the exit tunnel.},

Three structural features are found to be directly involved in the initial steps of leucine transport: a Na+ ion directly coordinated to leucine (Na-1), two aromatic residues closing the binding site toward the extracellular vestibule (Tyr-108 and Phe-253), and a salt bridge in the extracellular vestibule (Arg-30 and Asp-404). These features account for observed differences between simulations of LeuT with and without bound substrate and for a possible pathway for leucine binding and thereby formation of the occluded LeuT binding site. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

Here we report X-ray crystallographic structures of human SERT at 3.15 {\AA} resolution bound to the antidepressants (S)-citalopram or paroxetine. Antidepressants lock SERT in an outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding. We further identify the location of an allosteric site in the complex as residing at the periphery of the extracellular vestibule, interposed between extracellular loops 4 and 6 and transmembrane helices 1, 6, 10 and 11. Occupancy of the allosteric site sterically hinders ligand unbinding from the central site, providing an explanation for the action of (S)-citalopram as an allosteric ligand.

abstract = {The biogenic amine transporters (BATs) regulate endogenous neurotransmitter concentrations and are targets for a broad range of therapeutic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin- noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Because eukaryotic BATs are recalcitrant to crystallographic analysis, our understanding of the mechanism of these inhibitors and antidepressants is limited. LeuT is a bacterial homologue of BATs and has proven to be a valuable paradigm for understanding relationships between their structure and function. However, because only approximately 25% of the amino acid sequence of LeuT is in common with that of BATs, and as LeuT is a promiscuous amino acid transporter, it does not recapitulate the pharmacological properties of BATs. Indeed, SSRIs and TCAs bind in the extracellular vestibule of LeuT and act as non-competitive inhibitors of transport. By contrast, multiple studies demonstrate that both TCAs and SSRIs are competitive inhibitors for eukaryotic BATs and bind to the primary binding pocket. Here we engineered LeuT to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by mutating key residues around the primary binding pocket. The final LeuBAT mutant binds the SSRI sertraline with a binding constant of 18 nM and displays high-affinity binding to a range of SSRIs, SNRIs and a TCA. We determined 12 crystal structures of LeuBAT in complex with four classes of antidepressants. The chemically diverse inhibitors have a remarkably similar mode of binding in which they straddle transmembrane helix (TM) 3, wedge between TM3/TM8 and TM1/TM6, and lock the transporter in a sodium-and chloride-bound outward-facing open conformation. Together, these studies define common and simple principles for the action of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs on BATs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

AR2 expels intracellular protons through the decarboxylation of l-glutamate (Glu) in the cytoplasm and exchange of the reaction product $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with extracellular Glu. The latter process is mediated by the Glu-GABA antiporter GadC, a representative member of the amino-acid-polyamine- organocation superfamily of membrane transporters. The functional mechanism of GadC remains largely unknown. Here we show, with the use of an in vitro proteoliposome-based assay, that GadC transports GABA/Glu only under acidic conditions, with no detectable activity at pHvalues higher than 6.5. We determined the crystal structure of E.coli GadC at 3.1{\AA} resolution under basic conditions. GadC, comprising 12 transmembrane segments (TMs), exists in a closed state, with its carboxy-terminal domain serving as a plug to block an otherwise inward-open conformation. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal the essential transport residues, identify the transport path and suggest a conserved transport mechanism involving the rigid-body rotation of a helical bundle for GadC and other amino acid antiporters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In this study, we demonstrate that GadC selectively transports Glu with no net charge and GABA with a positive charge. AC-plug-truncated variant of GadC (residues 1-470) transported Gln (a mimic of Glu with no net charge), but not Glu, even at pH 8.0.

Specifically, we consider the cofactor binding fragment of CysB; the lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein (LAO); the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD); the ribose-binding protein (RBP); the N-terminal lobe of ovotransferrin in apo-form (apo-OVOT); and the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP). All have domains that resemble a Rossmann fold, but there are also some significant differences. Results indicate that similar global dynamic behavior is preserved for the members of a fold family, and that differences usually occur in regions only where specific function is localized. The present work is a computational demonstration that the scaffold of a protein fold may be utilized for diverse purposes. LAO requires a bound ligand before it conforms to the large-scale fluctuation behavior of the three other members of the family, CysB, PBGD, and RBP, all of which contain a substrate (cofactor) at the active site cleft. The dynamics of the ligand-free enzymes LIVBP and apo- OVOT, on the other hand, concur with that of unliganded LAO.

abstract = {The neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) belonging to the solute carrier 6 (SLC6) gene family (also referred to as the neurotransmitter-sodium- symporter family or Na +/Cl --dependent transporters) comprise a group of nine sodium- and chloride- dependent plasma membrane transporters for the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), dopamine, and norepinephrine, and the amino acid neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. The SLC6 NTTs are widely expressed in the mammalian brain and play an essential role in regulating neurotransmitter signaling and homeostasis by mediating uptake of released neurotransmitters from the extracellular space into neurons and glial cells. The transporters are targets for a wide range of therapeutic drugs used in treatment of psychiatric diseases, including major depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy. Furthermore, psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines have the SLC6 NTTs as primary targets. Beginning with the determination of a high-resolution structure of a prokaryotic homolog of the mammalian SLC6 transporters in 2005, the understanding of the molecular structure, function, and pharmacology of these proteins has advanced rapidly. Furthermore, intensive efforts have been directed toward understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in regulation of the activity of this important class of transporters, leading to new methodological developments and important insights. This review provides an update of these advances and their implications for the current understanding of the SLC6 NTTs. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.},

Neurotransmitter transporters, targets of abused and therapeutic drugs, require Na+ and Cl- for function. We recently proposed a chloride-binding site in these proteins not present in Cl --independent prokaryotic homologues. Here we describe conversion of the Cl--independent prokaryotic tryptophan transporter TnaT to a fully functional Cl--dependent form by a single point mutation, D268S. Mutations in TnaT-D268S, in wild type TnaT and in serotonin transporter provide direct evidence for the involvement of each of the proposed residues in Cl- coordination. In both SERT and TnaT-D268S, Cl- and Na+ mutually increased each other's potency, consistent with electrostatic interaction through adjacent binding sites. These studies establish the site where Cl- binds to trigger conformational change during neurotransmitter transport. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) have a critical role in regulating neurotransmission and are targets for psychostimulants, anti-depressants and other drugs. Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance, in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter. In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent. The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions, and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters. However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1) renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The recent determination of the crystal structure of the leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus (aaLeuT) has provided significant insights into the function of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters. Transport by aaLeuT is Cl- independent, whereas many neurotransmitter:sodium symporters from higher organisms depend on Cl- ions. However, the only Cl - ion identified in the aaLeuT structure interacts with nonconserved residues in extracellular loops, and thus the relevance of this binding site is unclear. Here, we use calculations of pKAs and homology modeling to predict the location of a functionally important Cl- binding site in serotonin transporter and other Cl--dependent transporters. We validate our model through the site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to coordinate the Cl- ion and through the observation of sequence conservation patterns in other Cl --dependent transporters. The proposed site is located midway across the membrane and is formed by residues from transmembrane helices 2, 6, and 7. It is close to the Na1 sodium binding site, thus providing an explanation for the coupling of Cl- and Na+ ions during transport. Other implications of the model are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Whereas eukaryotic NSS show chloride-dependent transport, bacterial NSS feature Cl -independent substrate transport. Recently we showed that mutation of an acidic residue near one of the sodium iong-binding sites in LeuT of Aquifex aeolicus or Tyt1 of Fusobacterium nucleatum renders substrate binding and/or transport Cl- dependent. We reasoned that the negative chargeg-provided either by Cl- or by the transporter itselfg-is required for substrate translocation. Here we show that Tyt1 reconstituted in proteoliposomes is strictly dependent on the Na + gradient and is stimulated by an inside negative membrane potential and by an inversely oriented proton gradient. Notably, Na + /substrate symport elicited H + efflux, indicative of Na + /substrate symportg-coupled H + antiport. Mutations that render the transport phenotype Cl- dependent essentially abolish the pH dependence.

Here we report crystal structures of Aquifex aeolicus LeuT in an outward-oriented, Na+- and substrate-free state likely to be H+-occluded. We find a remarkable rotation of the conserved Leu25 into the empty substrate-binding pocket and rearrangements of the empty Na+ sites. Mutational studies of the equivalent Leu99 in the human serotonin transporter show a critical role of this residue on the transport rate. Molecular dynamics simulations show that extracellular Na+ is blocked unless Leu25 is rotated out of the substrate-binding pocket. We propose that Leu25 facilitates the inward-to-outward transition by compensating a Na+- and substrate-free state and acts as the gatekeeper for Na+ binding that prevents leak in inward-outward return transitions.},

The stoichiometry of transported 5-HT and ions is predicted to result in electroneutral charge movement. However, hSERT mediates a current when challenged with 5-HT. This discrepancy can be accounted for by an uncoupled ion flux. Here, we investigated the mechanistic basis of the uncoupled currents and its relation to the conformational cycle of hSERT. Our observations support the conclusion that the conducting state underlying the uncoupled ion flux is in equilibrium with an inward facing state of the transporter with K + bound. We identified conditions associated with accumulation of the transporter in inward facing conformations. Manipulations that increased the abundance of inward facing states resulted in enhanced steady-state currents. We present a comprehensive kinetic model of the transport cycle, which recapitulates salient features of the recorded currents.

We demonstrate the feasibility of using this approach for the K+ channels KcsA and MVP and the amino acid transporter LeuT. We determine the crystal structure of the KcsA channel obtained by CFPS and in vitro folding to show the structural similarity to the cellular expressed KcsA channel and to establish the feasibility of using this two-step approach for membrane protein production for structural studies. Our studies show that the correct folding of these membrane proteins with complex topologies can take place in vitro without the involvement of the cellular machinery for membrane protein biogenesis.

Evaluation of orientation-selective DEER (os DEER) on systems with limited flexibility was probed using a series of porphyrin-based Cu(ii)-nitroxide and Cu(ii)-Cu(ii) model systems of well-defined lengths synthesized for this project. Density functional theory was employed to generate molecular models of the conformers for each porphyrin-based Cu(ii) dimer studied. Excellent agreement was found between DEER traces simulated using these computed conformers and the experimental data. The performance of different parameterised structural models in simulating the experimental DEER data was also investigated. The results of this analysis demonstrate the degree to which the DEER data define the relative orientation of the two Cu(ii) ions and highlight the need to choose a parameterised model that captures the essential features of the flexibility (rotational freedom) of the system being studied.},

The strength of this hybrid approach is shown by an application to the flexible multidomain protein Hsp90. The average solution structure of Hsp90's closed state resembles the known X-ray crystal structure with Angstrom precision. The open state is represented by an ensemble of conformations with interdomain fluctuations of up to 25 {\AA}.

abstract = {Site specific incorporation of molecular probes such as fluorescent- and nitroxide spin-labels into biomolecules, and subsequent analysis by F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) can elucidate the distance and distance-changes between the probes. However, the probes have an intrinsic conformational flexibility due to the linker by which they are conjugated to the biomolecule. This property minimizes the influence of the label side chain on the structure of the target molecule, but complicates the direct correlation of the experimental inter-label distances with the macromolecular structure or changes thereof. Simulation methods that account for the conformational flexibility and orientation of the probe(s) can be helpful in overcoming this problem. We performed distance measurements using FRET and DEER and explored different simulation techniques to predict inter-label distances using the Rpo4/7 stalk module of the M. jannaschii RNA polymerase. This is a suitable model system because it is rigid and a high-resolution X-ray structure is available. The conformations of the fluorescent labels and nitroxide spin labels on Rpo4/7 were modeled using in vacuo molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and a stochastic Monte Carlo sampling approach. For the nitroxide probes we also performed MD simulations with explicit water and carried out a rotamer library analysis. Our results show that the Monte Carlo simulations are in better agreement with experiments than the MD simulations and the rotamer library approach results in plausible distance predictions. Because the latter is the least computationally demanding of the methods we have explored, and is readily available to many researchers, it prevails as the method of choice for the interpretation of DEER distance distributions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Klose et al.},

abstract = {Although much of the motivation for experimental studies of protein folding is to obtain insights for improving protein structure prediction, there has been relatively little connection between experimental protein folding studies and computational structural prediction work in recent years. In the present study, we show that the relationship between protein folding rates and the contact order (CO) of the native structure has implications for ab initio protein structure prediction. Rosetta ab initio folding simulations produce a dearth of high CO structures and an excess of low CO structures, as expected if the computer simulations mimic to some extent the actual folding process. Consistent with this, the majority of failures in ab initio prediction in the CASP4 (critical assessment of structure prediction) experiment involved high CO structures likely to fold much more slowly than the lower CO structures for which reasonable predictions were made. This bias against high CO structures can be partially alleviated by performing large numbers of additional simulations, selecting out the higher CO structures, and eliminating the very low CO structures; this leads to a modest improvement in prediction quality. More significant improvements in predictions for proteins with complex topologies may be possible following significant increases in high-performance computing power, which will be required for thoroughly sampling high CO conformations (high CO proteins can take six orders of magnitude longer to fold than low CO proteins). Importantly for such a strategy, simulations performed for high CO structures converge much less strongly than those for low CO structures, and hence, lack of simulation convergence can indicate the need for improved sampling of high CO conformations. The parallels between Rosetta simulations and folding in vivo may extend to misfolding: The very low CO structures that accumulate in Rosetta simulations consist primarily of local up-down beta-sheets that may resemble precursors to amyloid formation.},

abstract = {Ion channels catalyze the selective transfer of ions across the membrane in response to a variety of stimuli. These channels gate by controlling the access of ions to a centrally located water-filled pore. The crystal structure of the Streptomyces lividans potassium channel (KcsA) has allowed a molecular exploration of this mechanism. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have uncovered significant conformational changes at the intracellular end of the second transmembrane helix (TM2) upon gating. We have used site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and EPR spectroscopy in an attempt to quantify the structural rearrangements of the KcsA TM2 bundle underlying the transition from the closed to the open state. Under conditions favoring the closed and open conformations, 10 intersubunit distances were obtained across TM2 segments from tandem dimer constructs. Analysis of these data points to a mechanism in which each TM2 helix tilts away from the permeation pathway, towards the membrane plane, and rotates about its helical axis, supporting a scissoring-type motion with a pivot point near residues 107-108. These movements are accompanied by a large increase in the diameter of the vestibule below the central water-filled cavity.},

The method, named restraint-driven Cartesian transformations, involves 1) the use of relative distance changes; 2) the systematic sampling of rigid body movements in Cartesian space; 3) a penalty evaluation; and 4) model refinement using energy minimization. As a test case, we have analyzed the structural basis of activation gating in the Streptomyces lividans potassium channel (KcsA). A total of 10 pairs of distance restraints derived from site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) spectra were used to calculate the open conformation of the second transmembrane domains of KcsA (TM2). The SDSL-EPR based structure reveals a gating mechanism consistent with a scissoring-type motion of the TM2 segments that includes a pivot point near middle of the helix. The present approach considerably reduces the amount of time and effort required to establish the overall nature of conformational changes in membrane proteins. It is expected that this approach can be implemented into restrained molecular dynamics protocol to calculate the structure and conformational changes in a variety of membrane protein systems.},

Our results show NS1 to be well amenable to nanometer distance measurements by EPR, yielding high quality data. In combination with mutants perturbing protein dimerization and in silico prediction based on crystal structures, we can exclude one of two potential dimerization interfaces. Furthermore, our results lead to a viable hypothesis of a NS1 ED:ED interface which is flexible through rotation around the vector interconnecting the two native cysteines.

The method employs a high-coordination lattice representation of the protein chain that incorporates a variety of potentials designed to produce protein-like behaviour. These include statistical preferences for secondary structure, side-chain burial interactions, and a hydrogen-bond potential. Using this algorithm, several globular proteins (1ctf, 2gbl, 2trx, 3fxn, 1mba, 1pcy and 6pti) have been folded to moderate-resolution, native-like compact states. For example, the 68 residue 1ctf molecule having ten loosely defined, long-range restraints was reproducibly obtained with a C($\alpha$)-backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from native of about 4. {\AA}. Flavodoxin with 35 restraints has been folded to structures whose average RMSD is 4.28 {\AA}. Furthermore, using just 20 restraints, myoglobin, which is a 146 residue helical protein, has been folded to structures whose average RMSD from native is 5.65 {\AA}. Plastocyanin with 25 long-range restraints adopts conformations whose average RMSD is 5.44 {\AA}. Possible applications of the proposed approach to the refinement of structures from NMR data, homology model-building and the determination of tertiary structure when the secondary structure and a small number of restraints are predicted are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility of elucidating the bound ("closed") conformation of a periplasmic binding protein, the glutamine-binding protein (GlnBP), in solution, using paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) arising from a single paramagnetic group. GlnBP consists of two globular domains connected by a hinge. Using the ligand-free ("open") conformation as a starting point, conjoined rigid-body/torsion-angle simulated annealing calculations were performed using backbone 1HN-PREs as a major source of distance information. Paramagnetic probe flexibility was accounted for via a multiple-conformer representation. A conventional approach where the entire PRE data set is enforced at once during simulated annealing yielded poor results due to inappropriate conformational sampling of the probe. On the other hand, significant improvements in coordinate accuracy were obtained by estimating the probe sampling space prior to structure calculation. Such sampling is achieved by refining the ensemble of probe conformers with intradomain PREs only, keeping the protein backbone fixed in the open form. Subsequently, while constraining the probe to the previously found conformations, the domains are allowed to move relative to each other under the influence of the non-intradomain PREs, giving the hinge region torsional degrees of freedom. Thus, by partitioning the protocol into "probe sampling" and "backbone sampling" stages, structures significantly closer to the X-ray structure of ligand-bound GlnBP were obtained. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

Distance distributions involving residue 3 near the N terminus turned out to be bimodal, revealing that this domain, which is involved in regulatory functions such as balancing the energy flow through photosystems (PS) I and II, exists in at least two conformational states. Models of the conformational sub-ensembles were generated on the basis of experimental distance restraints from measurements on LHCIIb monomers and then checked for consistency with the experimental distance distribution between residues 3 in trimers. Only models where residue 3 is located above the core of the protein and extends into the aqueous phase on the stromal side fit the trimer data. In the other state, which consequently is populated only in monomers, the N-terminal domain extends sideways from the protein core. The two conformational states may correspond to two functional states of LHCIIb, namely trimeric LHCIIb associated with PSII in stacked thylakoid membranes and presumably monomeric LHCIIb associated with PSI in nonstacked thylakoids. The switch between these two is known to be triggered by phosphorylation of Thr-6. A similar phosphorylation-induced conformational change of the N-terminal domain has been observed by others in bovine annexin IV which, due to the conformational switch, also loses its membrane-aggregating property. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The outer vestibule is an important structurally extended region of KcsA in which toxins, blockers, and metal ions bind and modulate the gating behavior of K+ channels. Despite its functional significance, the gating-related structural dynamics at the outer vestibule are not well understood. Under steady-state conditions, inactivating WT and noninactivating E71A KcsA stabilize the nonconductive and conductive filter conformations upon opening the activation gate. Site-directed fluorescence polarization of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD)- labeled outer vestibule residues shows that the outer vestibule of open/conductive conformation is highly dynamic compared with the motional restriction experienced by the outer vestibule during inactivation gating. A wavelength-selective fluorescence approach shows a change in hydration dynamics in inactivated and noninactivated conformations, and supports a possible role of restricted/ bound water molecules in C-type inactivation gating. Using a unique restrained ensemble simulation method, along with distance measurements by EPR, we show that, on average, the outer vestibule undergoes a modest backbone conformational change during its transition to various functional states, although the structural dynamics of the outer vestibule are significantly altered during activation and inactivation gating. Taken together, our results support the role of a hydrogen bond network behind the selectivity filter, sidechain conformational dynamics, and water molecules in the gating mechanisms of K+ channels.},

In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on integrating distinct and complementary methodologies for structure determination of multiprotein complexes. One approach not yet widely used is to obtain intermediate and long-range distance constraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based techniques such as double electron electron resonance (DEER), which, when used together, can provide supplemental distance constraints spanning to 10-70 {\AA}. In this Communication, we describe integration of PRE and DEER data with conventional solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for structure determination of Dsy0195, a homodimer (62 amino acids per monomer) from Desulfitobacterium hafniense. Our results indicate that combination of conventional NMR restraints with only one or a few DEER distance constraints and a small number of PRE constraints is sufficient for the automatic NMR-based structure determination program CYANA to build a network of interchain nuclear Overhauser effect constraints that can be used to accurately define both the homodimer interface and the global homodimer structure. The use of DEER distances as a source of supplemental constraints as described here has virtually no upper molecular weight limit, and utilization of the PRE constraints is limited only by the ability to make accurate assignments of the protein amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitter/Na+ symporters (NSSs) terminate neuronal signalling by recapturing neurotransmitter released into the synapse in a co-transport (symport) mechanism driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient1-6. NSSs for dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin are targeted by the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine1, as well as by antidepressants7. The crystal structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic NSS homologue, revealed an occluded conformation in which a leucine (Leu) and two Na+ are bound deep within the protein8. This structure has been the basis for extensive structural and computational exploration of the functional mechanisms of proteins with a LeuT-like fold9-22. Subsequently, an outward-open conformation was determined in the presence of the inhibitor tryptophan23, and the Na+-dependent formation of a dynamic outward-facing intermediate was identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy24. In addition, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging has been used to reveal reversible transitions to an inward-open LeuT conformation, which involve the movement of transmembrane helix TM1a away from the transmembrane helical bundle22. We investigated how substrate binding is coupled to structural transitions in LeuT during Na+-coupled transport. Here we report a process whereby substrate binding from the extracellular side of LeuT facilitates intracellular gate opening and substrate release at the intracellular face of the protein. In the presence of alanine, a substrate that is transported â¼10-fold faster than leucine15,25, we observed alanine-induced dynamics in the intracellular gate region of LeuT that directly correlate with transport efficiency. Collectively, our data reveal functionally relevant and previously hidden aspects of the NSS transport mechanism that emphasize the functional importance of a second substrate (S2) binding site within the extracellular vestibule15,22. Substrate binding in this S2 site appears to act cooperatively with the primary substrate (S1) binding site to control intracellular gating more than 30 {\AA} away, in a manner that allows the Na+ gradient to power the transport mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Secondary active transporters exploit the electrochemical potential of solutes to shuttle specific substrate molecules across biological membranes, usually against their concentration gradient. Transporters of different functional families with little sequence similarity have repeatedly been found to exhibit similar folds, exemplified by the MFS, LeuT, and NhaA folds. Observations of multiple conformational states of the same transporter, represented by the LeuT erfamily members Mhp1, AdiC, vSGLT, and LeuT, led to proposals that structural changes are associated with substrate binding and transport. Despite recent biochemical and structural advances, our understanding of substrate recognition and energy coupling is rather preliminary. This review focuses on the common folds and shared transport mechanisms of secondary active transporters. Available structural ormation generally ports the alternating access model for substrate transport, with variations and extensions made by emerging structural, biochemical, and computational evidence.

abstract = {Inferring three-dimensional structural information of biomacromolecules such as proteins from limited experimental data is an important and challenging task. Nuclear Overhauser effect measurements based on nucleic magnetic resonance, disulfide linking, and electron paramagnetic resonance labeling studies can all provide useful partial distance constraint characteristic of the conformations of proteins. In this study, we describe a general approach for reconstructing conformations of biomolecules that are consistent with given distance constraints. Such constraints can be in the form of upper bounds and lower bounds of distances between residue pairs, contact maps based on specific contact distance cutoff values, or indirect distance constraints such as experimental $\phi$ -value measurement. Our approach is based on the framework of sequential Monte Carlo method, a chain growth-based method. We have developed a novel growth potential function to guide the generation of conformations that satisfy given distance constraints. This potential function incorporates not only the distance information of current residue during growth but also the distance information of future residues by introducing global distance upper bounds between residue pairs and the placement of reference points. To obtain protein conformations from indirect distance constraints in the form of experimental $\phi$ -values, we first generate properly weighted contact maps satisfying $\phi$ -value constraints, we then generate conformations from these contact maps. We show that our approach can faithfully generate conformations that satisfy the given constraints, which approach the native structures when distance constraints for all residue pairs are given. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Herein we present a computational technique for generating helix-membrane protein folds matching a predefined set of distance constraints, such as those obtained from NMR NOE, chemical cross-linking, dipolar EPR, and FRET experiments. The purpose of the technique is to provide initial structures for local conformational searches based on either energetic considerations or ad-hoc scoring criteria. In order to properly screen the conformational space, the technique generates an exhaustive list of conformations within a specified root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) where the helices are positioned in order to match the provided distances. Our results indicate that the number of structures decreases exponentially as the number of distances increases, and increases exponentially as the errors associated with the distances increases. We also found the number of solutions to be smaller when all the distances share one helix in common, compared to the case where the distances connect helices in a daisy-chain manner. We found that for 7 helices, at least 15 distances with errors up to 8 A are needed to produce a number of solutions that is not too large to be processed by local search refinement procedures. Finally, without energetic considerations, our enumeration technique retrieved the transmembrane domains of Bacteriorhodopsin (PDB entry1c3w), Halorhodopsin (1e12), Rhodopsin (1f88), Aquaporin-1 (1fqy), Glycerol uptake facilitator protein (1fx8), Sensory Rhodopsin (1jgj), and a subunit of Fumarate reductase flavoprotein (1qlaC) with Calpha level RMSDs of 3.0 A, 2.3 A, 3.2 A, 4.6 A, 6.0 A, 3.7 A, and 4.4 A, respectively.},

abstract = {Interpretation of EPR measurables from spin labels in terms of structure and dynamics requires knowledge of label behavior. General strategies were developed for simulation of labels used in EPR of proteins. The criteria for those simulations are (a) exhaustive sampling of rotamer space, (b) consensus of results independent of starting points, and (c) inclusion of entropy. These criteria are satisfied only when the number of transitions in any dihedral angle exceeds 100 and the simulation maintains thermodynamic equilibrium. Methods such as conventional MD do not efficiently cross energetic barriers, simulated anealing, Monte Carlo or popular Rotamer Library methodologies are potential energy based and ignore entropy (in addition to their specific shortcomings: environment fluctuations, fixed environment, or electrostatics). The Simulated scaling method avoids the above flaws by modulating the force fields between a reduced (allowing crossing energy barriers) and full potential (sampling minima). Spin label diffuses on this surface while remaining in thermodynamic equilibrium. Simulations show that (a) adopting a single conformation is rare, often there are two to four populated rotamers and (b) position of the NO varies up to 16 {\AA}. These results illustrate necessity for caution when interpreting EPR signals in terms of molecular structure. For example, the 10-16 {\AA} distance change in DEER should not be interpreted as a large conformational change, it can well be a flip about C$\alpha$-C$\beta$ bond. Rigorous exploration of possible rotamer structures of a spin label is paramount in signal interpretation. We advocate use of bifunctional labels, motion of which is restricted 10,000-fold and the NO position is restricted to 2-5 {\AA}.},

abstract = {A disulfide-linked nitroxide side chain (R1) is the most widely used spin label for determining protein topology, mapping structural changes, and characterizing nanosecond backbone motions by site-directed spin labeling. Although the internal motion of R1 and the number of preferred rotamers are limited, translating interspin distance measurements and spatial orientation information into structural constraints is challenging. Here, we introduce a highly constrained nitroxide side chain designated RX as an alternative to R1 for these applications. RX is formed by a facile cross-linking reaction of a bifunctional methanethiosulfonate reagent with pairs of cysteine residues at i and i + 3 or i and i + 4 in an $\alpha$-helix, at i and i + 2 in a $\beta$-strand, or with cysteine residues in adjacent strands in a $\beta$-sheet. Analysis of EPR spectra, a crystal structure of RX in T4 lysozyme, and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR) spectroscopy on an immobilized protein containing RX all reveal a highly constrained internal motion of the side chain. Consistent with the constrained geometry, interspin distance distributions between pairs of RX side chains are narrower than those from analogous R1 pairs. As an important consequence of the constrained internal motion of RX, spectral diffusion detected with ELDOR reveals microsecond internal motions of the protein. Collectively, the data suggest that the RX side chain will be useful for distance mapping by EPR spectroscopy, determining spatial orientation of helical segments in oriented specimens, and measuring structural fluctuations on the microsecond time scale.},

abstract = {Pulsed Electron-electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) is a method frequently used to determine the distances between paramagnetic centers in biomacromolecules on the nanometer scale. A standard algorithm for determination of distances from the experimental data assumes that all possible mutual orientations of the spin labels are equally probable. However, in many applications the mobility of the spin labels attached to large molecules can be significantly restricted. In order to determine the total PELDOR signal in this case, the individual contributions of each rigid biradical should be explicitly calculated for the given frequencies of the probe and pump pulses. The solution of the inverse problem of determination of the ensemble of molecular structures that fit the experimental PELDOR data acquired at multiple microwave frequencies and magnetic fields has proven to be a non-trivial task, especially, when no information about the molecular structure under study is available. In this work we present a fitting algorithm that reconstructs experimental data by searching for an optimal combination of presimulated PELDOR time traces for nitroxide biradicals with all relative orientations and with inter-spin distances in the experimentally accessible range. The generated library of PELDOR time traces has been employed to excellently fit experimental data containing orientation selection effects gathered on model biradical systems. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies 2013.},

Site-directed spin-labeling using (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5- tetramethyl-3-pyrrolin-3-yl)methyl methanethiosulfonate was performed with a R64C mutant of the protein. The orientations of the spin-labels in the tetramer were determined by PELDOR experiments performed at two magnetic field strengths (0.3 T/X-band and 1.2 T/Q-band) and variable probe frequency. Quantitative simulation of the PELDOR data supports a strongly restricted nitroxide, oriented at an angle of 65Â° relative to the central channel axis. In general, poorer quality PELDOR data were obtained from membrane-reconstituted preparations compared to soluble proteins or detergent-solubilized samples. One reason for this is the reduced transverse spin relaxation time T2 of nitroxides due to crowding of tetramers within the membrane that occurs even at low protein to lipid ratios. This reduced T2 can be overcome by reconstituting mixtures of unlabeled and labeled proteins, yielding high-quality PELDOR data. Identical PELDOR oscillation frequencies and their dependencies on the probe frequency were observed in the detergent and membrane-reconstituted preparations, indicating that the position and orientation of the spin-labels are the same in both environments. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance using site-directed spin labeling can be used as an approach for determination of protein structures that are difficult to solve by other methods. One important aspect of this approach is the measurement of interlabel distances using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) method. Interpretation of experimental data could be facilitated by a computational approach to calculation of interlabel distances. We describe an algorithm, PRONOX, for rapid computation of interlabel distances based on calculation of spin label conformer distributions at any site of a protein. The program incorporates features of the label distribution established experimentally, including weighting of favorable conformers of the label. Distances calculated by PRONOX were compared with new DEER distances for amphiphysin and annexin B12 and with published data for FCHo2 (F-BAR), endophilin, and $\alpha$-synuclein, a total of 44 interlabel distances. The program reproduced these distances accurately (r 2 = 0.94, slope = 0.98). For 9 of the 11 distances for amphiphysin, PRONOX reproduced the experimental data to within 2.5 {\AA}. The speed and accuracy of PRONOX suggest that the algorithm can be used for fitting to DEER data for determination of protein tertiary structure.

abstract = {Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) at W-band (95 GHz) was applied to measure the distance between a pair of nitroxide and Gd3+ chelate spin labels, about 6 nm apart, in a homodimer of the protein ERp29. While high-field DEER measurements on systems with such mixed labels can be highly attractive in terms of sensitivity and the potential to access long distances, a major difficulty arises from the large frequency spacing (about 700 MHz) between the narrow, intense signal of the Gd3+ central transition and the nitroxide signal. This is particularly problematic when using standard single-mode cavities. Here we show that a novel dual-mode cavity that matches this large frequency separation dramatically increases the sensitivity of DEER measurements, allowing evolution times as long as 12 $\mu$s in a protein. This opens the possibility of accessing distances of 8 nm and longer. In addition, orientation selection can be resolved and analyzed, thus providing additional structural information. In the case of W-band DEER on a Gd3+- nitroxide pair, only two angles and their distributions have to be determined, which is a much simpler problem to solve than the five angles and their distributions associated with two nitroxide spin labels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Protein spin labeling to yield the nitroxide-based R1 side chain is a powerful method to measure protein dynamics and structure by electron spin resonance. However, R1 measurements are complicated by the flexibility of the side chain. While analysis approaches for solvent-exposed $\alpha$-helical environment have been developed to partially account for flexibility, similar work in $\beta$-sheets is lacking. The goal of this study is to provide the first essential steps for understanding the conformational preferences of R1 within edge $\beta$-strands using X-ray crystallography and double electron electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements. Crystal structures yielded seven rotamers for a non-hydrogen-bonded site and three rotamers for a hydrogen-bonded site. The observed rotamers indicate contextual differences in R1 conformational preferences compared to other solvent-exposed environments. For the DEER measurements, each strand site was paired with the same $\alpha$-helical site elsewhere on the protein. The most probable distance observed by DEER is rationalized based on the rotamers observed in the crystal structure. Additionally, the appropriateness of common molecular modeling methods that account for R1 conformational preferences are assessed for the $\beta$-sheet environment. These results show that interpretation of R1 behavior in $\beta$-sheets is difficult and indicate further development is needed for these computational methods to correctly relate DEER distances to protein structure at edge $\beta$-strand sites.},

Simple molecular modeling based on an X-ray crystal structure of an unlabeled protein led to a predicted most probable distance within 0.5{\AA} of the experimental value. Cu2+ DEER with the dHis motif shows great promise for the resolution of precise, unambiguous distance constraints that relate directly to protein-backbone structure and flexibility. That's great, DEER! When a double-histidine Cu2+-binding motif (shown in blue) assembled in situ from natural amino acid residues and a metal salt was used as a rigid spin probe for double electron-electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements, dramatically narrower and readily interpretable distance distributions were observed than with a commonly used flexible spin label (red).

abstract = {Understanding the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins in their native, hydrophobic environment is important to understanding how these proteins function. EPR spectroscopy in combination with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) can measure dynamics and structure of membrane proteins in their native lipid environment; however, until now the dynamics measured have been qualitative due to limited knowledge of the nitroxide spin label's intramolecular motion in the hydrophobic environment. Although several studies have elucidated the structural origins of EPR line shapes of water-soluble proteins, EPR spectra of nitroxide spin-labeled proteins in detergents or lipids have characteristic differences from their water-soluble counterparts, suggesting significant differences in the underlying molecular motion of the spin label between the two environments. To elucidate these differences, membrane-exposed $\alpha$-helical sites of the leucine transporter, LeuT, from Aquifex aeolicus, were investigated using X-ray crystallography, mutational analysis, nitroxide side chain derivatives, and spectral simulations in order to obtain a motional model of the nitroxide. For each crystal structure, the nitroxide ring of a disulfide-linked spin label side chain (R1) is resolved and makes contacts with hydrophobic residues on the protein surface. The spin label at site I204 on LeuT makes a nontraditional hydrogen bond with the ortho-hydrogen on its nearest neighbor F208, whereas the spin label at site F177 makes multiple van der Waals contacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed with an adjacent helix. These results coupled with the spectral effect of mutating the i Â± 3, 4 residues suggest that the spin label has a greater affinity for its local protein environment in the low dielectric than on a water-soluble protein surface. The simulations of the EPR spectra presented here suggest the spin label oscillates about the terminal bond nearest the ring while maintaining weak contact with the protein surface. Combined, the results provide a starting point for determining a motional model for R1 on membrane proteins, allowing quantification of nitroxide dynamics in the aliphatic environment of detergent and lipids. In addition, initial contributions to a rotamer library of R1 on membrane proteins are provided, which will assist in reliably modeling the R1 conformational space for pulsed dipolar EPR and NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement distance determination. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {As a whole, integral membrane proteins represent about one third of sequenced genomes, and more than 50% of currently available drugs target membrane proteins, often these are cell surface receptors. Some membrane protein classes, with a defined number of transmembrane (TM) helices, are receiving much attention because of their great functional and pharmacological importance, such as G protein-coupled receptors possessing 7 TM segments. Although they represent roughly half of all membrane proteins, bitopic proteins (with only 1 TM helix) have so far been less well characterized. Yet they include many essential families of receptors such as adhesion molecules and receptor tyrosine kinases, many of which are excellent targets for biopharmaceuticals (peptides, antibodies, ?). A growing body of evidence suggests a major role for interactions between TM domains of these receptors in signaling, through homo and heteromeric associations, conformational changes, assembly of signaling platforms, etc. Significantly, mutations within single domains are frequent in human disease, such as cancer or developmental disorders. This review attempts to give an overview of current knowledge about these interactions, from structural data to therapeutic perspectives, focusing on bitopic proteins involved in cell signaling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {We describe the adaptation of the Rosetta de novo structure prediction method for prediction of helical transmembrane protein structures. The membrane environment is modeled by embedding the protein chain into a model membrane represented by parallel planes defining hydrophobic, interface, and polar membrane layers for each energy evaluation. The optimal embedding is determined by maximizing the exposure of surface hydrophobic residues within the membrane and minimizing hydrophobic exposure outside of the membrane. Protein conformations are built up using the Rosetta fragment assembly method and evaluated using a new membrane-specific version of the Rosetta low-resolution energy function in which residue-residue and residue-environment interactions are functions of the membrane layer in addition to amino acid identity, distance, and density. We find that lower energy and more native-like structures are achieved by sequential addition of helices to a growing chain, which may mimic some aspects of helical protein biogenesis after translocation, rather than folding the whole chain simultaneously as in the Rosetta soluble protein prediction method. In tests on 12 membrane proteins for which the structure is known, between 51 and 145 residues were predicted with root-mean-square deviation <4 {\AA} from the native structure. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The prediction and design at the atomic level of membrane protein structures and interactions is a critical but unsolved challenge. To address this problem, we have developed an all-atom physical model that describes intraprotein and protein-solvent interactions in the membrane environment. We evaluated the ability of the model to recapitulate the energetics and structural specificities of polytopic membrane proteins by using a battery of in silico prediction and design tests. First, in side-chain packing and design tests, the model successfully predicts the side-chain conformations at 73% of nonexposed positions and the native amino acid identities at 34% of positions in naturally occurring membrane proteins. Second, the model predicts significant energy gaps between native and nonnative structures of transmembrane helical interfaces and polytopic membrane proteins. Third, distortions in transmembrane helices are successfully recapitulated in docking experiments by using fragments of ideal helices judiciously defined around helical kinks. Finally, de novo structure prediction reaches near-atomic accuracy (<2.5 {\AA}) for several small membrane protein domains (<150 residues). The success of the model highlights the critical role of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions in the stability and structural specificity of membrane protein structures and sets the stage for the high-resolution prediction and design of complex membrane protein architectures. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Membrane proteins are critical functional molecules in the human body, constituting more than 30% of open reading frames in the human genome. Unfortunately, a myriad of difficulties in overexpression and reconstitution into membrane mimetics severely limit our ability to determine their structures. Computational tools are therefore instrumental to membrane protein structure prediction, consequently increasing our understanding of membrane protein function and their role in disease. Here, we describe a general framework facilitating membrane protein modeling and design that combines the scientific principles for membrane protein modeling with the flexible software architecture of Rosetta3. This new framework, called RosettaMP, provides a general membrane representation that interfaces with scoring, conformational sampling, and mutation routines that can be easily combined to create new protocols. To demonstrate the capabilities of this implementation, we developed four proof-of-concept applications for (1) prediction of free energy changes upon mutation; (2) high-resolution structural refinement; (3) protein-protein docking; and (4) assembly of symmetric protein complexes, all in the membrane environment. Preliminary data show that these algorithms can produce meaningful scores and structures. The data also suggest needed improvements to both sampling routines and score functions. Importantly, the applications collectively demonstrate the potential of combining the flexible nature of RosettaMP with the power of Rosetta algorithms to facilitate membrane protein modeling and design.},

Despite a wealth of structural and functional data, the details of this conformational change remain controversial. Recent electrophysiological evidence showed that equilibrium between the resting ('down') and activated ('up') conformations of the KvAP VSD from Aeropyrum pernix can be biased through reconstitution in lipids with or without phosphate groups. We investigated the structural transition between these functional states, using site-directed spin-labeling and EPR spectroscopic methods. Solvent accessibility and interhelical distance determinations suggest that KvAP gates through S4 movements involving an â¼3-{\AA} upward tilt and simultaneous â¼2-{\AA} axial shift.

abstract = {We address the critically important ionization properties of histidine side chains of membrane proteins, when exposed directly to lipid acyl chains within lipid bilayer membranes. The problem is important for addressing general principles that may underlie membrane protein function. To this end, we have employed a favorable host peptide framework provided by GWALP23 (acetyl-GGALW5LALALALALALALW19LAGA-amide). We inserted His residues into position 12 or 14 of GWALP23 (replacing either Leu12or Leu14) and incorporated specific [2H]Ala labels within the helical core sequence. Solidstate 2H NMR spectra report the folding and orientation of the core sequence, revealing marked differences in the histidinecontaining transmembrane helix behavior between acidic and neutral pH conditions. At neutral pH, the GWALP23-H12 and GWALP23-H14 helices exhibit well defined tilted transmembrane orientations in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) bilayer membranes. Under acidic conditions, when His12is protonated and charged, the GWALP23-H12 helix exhibits a major population that moves to the DOPC bilayer surface and a minor population that occupies multiple transmembrane states. The response to protonation of His14 is an increase in helix tilt, but GWALP23-H14 remains in a transmembrane orientation. The results suggest pKavalues of less than 3 for His12 and about 3-5 for His14in DOPC membranes. In the thinner DLPC bilayers, with increased water access, the helices are less responsivetochanges in pH. The combined results enable us to compare the ionization properties of lipid-exposed His, Lys, and Arg side chains in lipid bilayer membranes.},

In recent microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations of a complete model of the dopamine transporter, a NSS protein, we observed a partitioning of K+ ions from the intracellular side toward the unoccupied Na2 site of dopamine transporter following the release of the Na2-bound Na+ . Here we evaluate with computational simulations and experimental measurements of ion affinities under corresponding conditions, the consequences of K+ binding in the Na2 site of LeuT, a bacterial homolog of NSS, when both Na+ ions and substrate have left, and the transporter prepares for a new cycle. We compare the results with the consequences of binding Na+ in the same apo system. Analysis of >50-$\mu$s atomistic molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling trajectories of constructs with Glu290 , either charged or neutral, point to the Glu290 protonation state as a main determinant in the structural reconfiguration of the extracellular vestibule of LeuT in which a "water gate" opens through coordinated motions of residues Leu25 , Tyr108 , and Phe253 . The resulting water channel enables the binding/dissociation of the Na+ and K+ ions that are prevalent, respectively, in the extracellular and intracellular environments.},

Building on the Rosetta framework, we present a general method to simultaneously model the folding and docking of multiple-chain interleaved homo-oligomers. For more than a third of the cases in a benchmark set of interleaved homo-oligomers, the method generates near-native models of large $\alpha$-helical bundles, interlocking $\beta$ sandwiches, and interleaved $\alpha$/$\beta$ motifs with an accuracy high enough for molecular replacement based phasing. With the incorporation of NMR chemical shift information, accurate models can be obtained consistently for symmetric complexes with as many as 192 total amino acids; a blind prediction was within 1 {\AA} rmsd of the traditionally determined NMR structure, and fit independently collected RDC data equally well. Together, these results show that the Rosetta "fold-and-dock" protocol can produce models of homo-oligomeric complexes with nearatomic-level accuracy and should be useful for crystallographic phasing and the rapid determination of the structures of multimers with limited NMR information.},

The large size of these systems often makes them difficult to structurally characterize using experimental techniques. We have developed a computational protocol to predict the structure of symmetrical protein assemblies based on the structure of a single subunit. The method carries out simultaneous optimization of backbone, side chain, and rigid-body degrees of freedom, while restricting the search space to symmetrical conformations. Using this protocol, we can reconstruct, starting from the structure of a single subunit, the structure of cyclic oligomers and the icosahedral virus capsid of satellite panicum virus using a rigid backbone approximation. We predict the oligomeric state of EscJ from the type III secretion system both in its proposed cyclical and crystallized helical form.

Although principal mechanistic elements of proton/substrate antiport have been described, the structural record is limited to the conformation of the substrate-bound state, which has been shown to undergo isoenergetic alternating access. A central but missing link in the structure/mechanism relationship is a description of the protonbound state, which is an obligatory intermediate in the transport cycle. Here we report a systematic spin labeling and double electron electron resonance (DEER) study that uncovers the conformational changes of EmrE subsequent to protonation of critical acidic residues in the context of a global description of ligand-induced structural rearrangements. We find that protonation of E14 leads to extensive rotation and tilt of transmembrane helices 1-3 in conjunction with repacking of loops, conformational changes that alter the coordination of the bound substrate and modulate its access to the binding site from the lipid bilayer. The transport model that emerges from our data posits a proton-bound, but occluded, resting state. Substrate binding from the inner leaflet of the bilayer releases the protons and triggers alternating access between inward-And outward-facing conformations of the substrate-loaded transporter, thus enabling antiport without dissipation of the proton gradient.},

Agm2+ and the "virtual" proton it carries are exported via AdiC subsequently. It is widely accepted that AdiC counters intracellular acidification by continuously pumping out virtual protons. However, in the gastric environment, Arg is present in two carboxyl-protonation forms, Arg+ and Arg2+. Virtual proton pumping can only be achieved by Arg+/Agm2+ exchange, whereas Arg 2+/Agm2+ exchange would produce no net proton movement. This study experimentally asks which exchange AdiC catalyzes, an issue previously unapproachable due to the absence of a reconstituted system mimicking the situation of bacteria in the stomach. Here, using an oriented liposome system able to hold a three-unit pH gradient, we demonstrate that Arg/Agm exchange by AdiC is strongly electrogenic with positive charge moved outward, and thus that AdiC mainly mediates Arg+/Agm2+ exchange to support effective virtual proton pumping. Further experiments reveal a mechanistic surprise-that AdiC selects Arg+ against Arg2+ on the basis of gross valence, rather than by local scrutiny of protonation states of the carboxyl group, as had been suggested by Arg-bound AdiC crystal structures.},

abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

As L-cystine is an essential precursor for glutathione synthesis, system xcâ supports tumor cell growth through glutathione-based oxidative stress resistance and is considered as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. System xcâ consists of two subunits, the light chain subunit SLC7A11 (xCT) and the heavy chain subunit SLC3A2 (also known as CD98hc or 4F2hc), which are linked by a conserved disulfide bridge. Although the recent structures of another SLC7 member, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) in complex with CD98hc, have provided the structural basis toward understanding the amino acid transport mechanism, the detailed molecular mechanism of xCT remains unknown. To revealthe molecular mechanism, we performed single-particle analyses of the xCT-CD98hc complex. As wild-type xCT-CD98hc displayed poor stability and could not be purified to homogeneity, we applied a consensus mutagenesis approach to xCT. The consensus mutated construct exhibited increased stability as compared to the wild-type, and enabled the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) map to be obtained at 6.2 {\AA} resolution by single-particle analysis. The cryo-EM map revealed sufficient electron density to assign secondary structures. In the xCT structure, the hash and arm domains are well resolved, whereas the bundle domain shows some flexibility. CD98hc is positioned next to the xCT transmembrane domain. This study provides the structural basis of xCT, and our consensus-based strategy could represent a good choice toward solving unstable protein structures.},

abstract = {The membrane is an integral component of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling machinery. Here we demonstrate that lipids regulate the signaling efficacy and selectivity of the ghrelin receptor GHSR through specific interactions and bulk effects. We find that PIP2 shifts the conformational equilibrium of GHSR away from its inactive state, favoring basal and agonist-induced G protein activation. This occurs because of a preferential binding of PIP2 to specific intracellular sites in the receptor active state. Another lipid, GM3, also binds GHSR and favors G protein activation, but mostly in a ghrelin-dependent manner. Finally, we find that not only selective interactions but also the thickness of the bilayer reshapes the conformational repertoire of GHSR, with direct consequences on G protein selectivity. Taken together, this data illuminates the multifaceted role of the membrane components as allosteric modulators of how ghrelin signal could be propagated.},

For this, we provide a general mathematical framework and its open-source software implementation. We extend an earlier approach by Edwards and Stoll for the selection of an optimal regularization parameter to all of these penalties and use their big test data set of noisy DEER traces with known ground truth for assessment. The results indicate that regularization methods based on Bregman iterations provide an improvement upon Tikhonov regularization in recognizing features and recovering distribution width at moderate signal-to-noise ratio, provided that noise variance is known. Bregman-iterative methods are robust with respect to the method used in the choice of regularization parameter.},

The subsequent release of cytochrome c initiates cell death. However, the structure of membrane-inserted Bax and its mechanism of action remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a 3D model of active Bax at the membrane based on double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy in liposomes and isolated mitochondria. We show that active Bax is organized at the membrane as assemblies of dimers. In addition to a stable dimerization domain, each monomer contains a more flexible piercing domain involved in interdimer interactions and pore formation. The most important structural change during Bax activation is the opening of the hairpin formed by helices 5 and 6, which adopts a clamp-like conformation central to the mechanism of mitochondrial permeabilization.},

Here we present the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of these transporters from Aquifex aeolicus, in complex with its substrate, leucine, and two sodium ions. The protein core consists of the first ten of twelve transmembrane segments, with segments 1-5 related to 6-10 by a pseudo-two-fold axis in the membrane plane. Leucine and the sodium ions are bound within the protein core, halfway across the membrane bilayer, in an occluded site devoid of water. The leucine and ion binding sites are defined by partially unwound transmembrane helices, with main-chain atoms and helix dipoles having key roles in substrate and ion binding. The structure reveals the architecture of this important class of transporter, illuminates the determinants of substrate binding and ion selectivity, and defines the external and internal gates. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

Here, we report crystal structures of LeuT representing new intermediate conformations between the outward-facing open and occluded states. These structures, combined with binding and accessibility studies, reveal details of conformational dynamics that can follow substrate binding at the central substrate binding site (S1) of LeuT in outward-facing states, suggesting a potential competition for direction between the outward-open and outward-occluded states at this stage during substrate transport. Our structures further support an intimate interplay between the protonation state of Glu290 and binding of Na1 that may ultimately regulate the outward-open-to-occluded transition.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which cotransport proteins couple their substrates across cell membranes is not known. A commonly proposed model is that cotransport results from ligand-induced conformational transitions that change the accessibility of ligand-binding sites from one side of the membrane to the other. To test this model, we have measured the accessibility of covalent probes to a cysteine residue (Q457C) placed in the putative sugar-translocation domain of the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1). The mutant protein Q457C was able to transport sugar, but transport was abolished after alkylation by methanethiosulfonate reagents. Alkylation blocked sugar translocation but not sugar binding. Accessibility of Q457C to alkylating reagents required external Na+ and was blocked by external sugar and phlorizin. The voltage dependence of accessibility was directly correlated with the presteady-state charge movement of SGLT1. Voltage-jump experiments with rhodamine-6-maleimide-labeled Q457C showed that the time course and level of changes in fluorescence closely followed the presteady-state charge movement. We conclude that conformational changes are responsible for the coupling of Na+ and sugar transport and that Q457 plays a critical role in sugar translocation by SGLT1.},

We recently found this region to be a second binding (S2) site and that binding of substrate to this site triggers Na +-coupled substrate symport. Here, we show a profound inhibitory effect of n-octyl-$\beta$-D-glucopyranoside (OG), the detergent used for LeuT crystallization, on substrate binding to the S2 site. In parallel, we determined at 2.8 A{\textregistered} the structure of LeuT-E290S, a mutant that, like LeuT-WT, binds 2 substrate molecules. This structure was similar to that of WT and clearly revealed an OG molecule in the S2 site. We also observed electron density at the S2 site in LeuT-WT crystals, and this also was accounted for by an OG molecule in that site. Computational analyses, based on the available crystal structures of LeuT, indicated the nature of structural arrangements in the extracellular region of LeuT that differentiate the actions of substrates from inhibitors bound in the S2 site. We conclude that the current LeuT crystal structures, all of which have been solved in OG, represent functionally blocked forms of the transporter, whereas a substrate bound in the S2 site will promote a different state that is essential for Na +-coupled symport.},

abstract = {Potassium-coupled chloride transporters (KCCs) play crucial roles in regulating cell volume and intracellular chloride concentration. They are characteristically inhibited under isotonic conditions via phospho-regulatory sites located within the cytoplasmic termini. Decreased inhibitory phosphorylation in response to hypotonic cell swelling stimulates transport activity, and dysfunction of this regulatory process has been associated with various human diseases. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human KCC3b and KCC1, revealing structural determinants for phospho-regulation in both N- and C-termini. We show that phospho-mimetic KCC3b is arrested in an inward-facing state in which intracellular ion access is blocked by extensive contacts with the N-terminus. In another mutant with increased isotonic transport activity, KCC1$\Delta$19, this interdomain interaction is absent, likely due to a unique phospho-regulatory site in the KCC1 N-terminus.

abstract = {During their mechanistic cycles membrane transporters often undergo extensive conformational changes, sampling a range of orientations, in order to complete their function. Such membrane transporters present somewhat of a challenge to conventional structural studies; indeed, crystallization of membrane-associated proteins sometimes require conditions that vary vastly from their native environments. Moreover, this technique currently only allows for visualization of single selected conformations during any one experiment. EPR spectroscopy is a magnetic resonance technique that offers a unique opportunity to study structural, environmental and dynamic properties of such proteins in their native membrane environments, as well as readily sampling their substrate-binding-induced dynamic conformational changes especially through complementary computational analyses. Here we present a review of recent studies that utilize a variety of EPR techniques in order to investigate both the structure and dynamics of a range of membrane transporters and associated proteins, focusing on both primary (ABC-type transporters) and secondary active transporters which were key interest areas of the late Professor Stephen Baldwin to whom this review is dedicated.},

abstract = {mTORC1 is a central hub that integrates environmental cues, such as cellular stresses and nutrient availability to modulate metabolism and cellular responses. Recently, SLC38A9, a lysosomal amino acid transporter, emerged as a sensor for luminal arginine and as an activator of mTORC1. The amino acid-mediated activation of mTORC1 is regulated by the N-terminal domain of SLC38A9. Here, we determined the crystal structure of zebrafish SLC38A9 (drSLC38A9) and found the N-terminal fragment inserted deep within the transporter, bound in the substrate-binding pocket where normally arginine would bind. This represents a significant conformational change of the N-terminal domain (N-plug) when compared with our recent arginine-bound structure of drSLC38A9. We propose a ball-and-chain model for mTORC1 activation, where N-plug insertion and Rag GTPase binding with SLC38A9 is regulated by luminal arginine levels. This work provides important insights into nutrient sensing by SLC38A9 to activate the mTORC1 pathways in response to dietary amino acids.},

Recently, we obtained atomic structures of BetP in distinct conformational states, which elucidated parts of its alternating-access mechanism. Here, we report a structure of BetP in a new outward-open state in complex with an anomalous scattering substrate, adding a fundamental piece to an unprecedented set of structural snapshots for a secondary transporter. In combination with molecular dynamics simulations these structural data highlight important features of the sequential formation of the substrate and sodium-binding sites, in which coordinating water molecules play a crucial role. We observe a strictly interdependent binding of betaine and sodium ions during the coupling process. All three sites undergo progressive reshaping and dehydration during the alternating-access cycle, with the most optimal coordination of all substrates found in the closed state. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The relationship between DNA sequence recognition and catalytic specificity in a DNA-modifying enzyme was explored using paramagnetic Cu 2+ ions as probes for ESR spectroscopic and biochemical studies. Electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy establishes that Cu 2+ coordinates to histidine residues in the EcoRI endonuclease homodimer bound to its specific DNA recognition site. The coordinated His residues were identified by a unique use of Cu 2+-ion based long-range distance constraints. Double electron- electron resonance data yield Cu 2+-Cu 2+ and Cu 2+-nitroxide distances that are uniquely consistent with one Cu 2+ bound to His114 in each subunit. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirms that two Cu 2+ ions bind per complex. Unexpectedly, Mg 2+-catalyzed DNA cleavage by EcoRI is profoundly inhibited by Cu 2+ binding at these hitherto unknown sites, 13 {\AA} away from the Mg 2+positions in the catalytic centers. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a model for inhibition of catalysis, whereby the Cu 2+ ions alter critical protein-DNA interactions and water molecule positions in the catalytic sites. In the absence of Cu 2+, the Mg 2+-dependence of EcoRI catalysis shows positive cooperativity, which would enhance EcoRI inactivation of foreign DNA by irreparable doublestrand cuts, in preference to readily repaired single-strand nicks. Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann calculations suggest that this cooperativity arises because the binding of Mg 2+ in one catalytic site makes the surface electrostatic potential in the distal catalytic site more negative, thus enhancing binding of the second Mg 2+. Taken together, our results shed light on the structural and electrostatic factors that affect site-specific catalysis by this class of endonucleases.},

abstract = {Many proteins consist of folded domains connected by regions with higher flexibility. The details of the resulting conformational ensemble play a central role in controlling interactions between domains and with binding partners. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is well-suited to study the conformational states adopted by proteins in solution. However, analysis is complicated by the limited information content in SAS data and care must be taken to avoid constructing overly complex ensemble models and fitting to noise in the experimental data. To address these challenges, we developed a method based on Bayesian statistics that infers conformational ensembles from a structural library generated by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. The first stage of the method involves a fast model selection based on variational Bayesian inference that maximizes the model evidence of the selected ensemble. This is followed by a complete Bayesian inference of population weights in the selected ensemble. Experiments with simulated ensembles demonstrate that model evidence is capable of identifying the correct ensemble and that correct number of ensemble members can be recovered up to high level of noise. Using experimental data, we demonstrate how the method can be extended to include data from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and structural energies of conformers extracted from the all-atom energy functions. We show that the data from SAXS, NMR chemical shifts and energies calculated from conformers can work synergistically to improve the definition of the conformational ensemble.},

The solution NMR structures of the YgaP transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytosolic catalytic rhodanese domain were reported recently, but the tertiary fold of full-length YgaP was not yet available. Here, systematic site-specific EPR analysis defined a helix-loop-helix secondary structure of the YagP-TMD monomers using mobility, accessibility and membrane immersion measurements. The tertiary folds of dimeric YgaP-TMD and full-length YgaP in detergent micelles were determined through inter- and intra-monomer distance mapping and rigid-body computation. Further EPR analysis demonstrated the tight packing of the two YgaP second transmembrane helices upon binding of the catalytic product SCN-, which provides insight into the thiocyanate exportation mechanism of YgaP in the E. coli membrane.},

abstract = {A disulfide-linked imidazoline nitroxide side chain (V1) has a similar and highly constrained internal motion at diverse topological sites in a protein, unlike that for the disulfide-linked pyrroline nitroxide side chain (R1) widely used in site directed spin labeling EPR. Crystal structures of V1 at two positions in a helix of T4 Lysozyme and quantum mechanical calculations suggest the source of the constraints as intra-side chain interactions of the disulfide sulfur atoms with both the protein backbone and the 3-nitrogen in the imidazoline ring. These interactions apparently limit the conformation of the side chain to one of only three possible rotamers, two of which are observed in the crystal structure. An inter-spin distance measurement in frozen solution using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) gives a value essentially identical to that determined from the crystal structure of the protein containing two copies of V1, indicating that lattice forces do not dictate the rotamers observed. Collectively, the results suggest the possibility of predetermining a unique rotamer of V1 in helical structures. In general, the reduced rotameric space of V1 compared to R1 should simplify interpretation of inter-spin distance information in terms of protein structure, while the highly constrained internal motion is expected to extend the dynamic range for characterizing large amplitude nanosecond backbone fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance experiments can measure individual distances between two spin-labeled side chains in proteins in the range of â¼1.5-8 nm. However, the flexibility of traditional spin-labeled side chains leads to diffuse spin density loci and thus distance distributions with relatively broad peaks, thereby complicating the interpretation of protein conformational states. Here we analyzed the spin-labeled V1 side chain, which is internally anchored and hence less flexible. Crystal structures of V1-labeled T4 lysozyme constructs carrying the V1 side chain on $\alpha$-helical segments suggest that V1 side chains adopt only a few discrete rotamers. In most cases, only one rotamer is observed at a given site, explaining the frequently observed narrow distance distribution for doubly V1-labeled proteins. We used the present data to derive guidelines that may allow distance interpretation of other V1-labeled proteins for higher-precision structural modeling.},

abstract = {The properties of the conformational landscape of a biomolecule are of capital importance to understand its function. It is widely accepted that a statistical ensemble is far more representative than a single structure, especially for proteins with disordered regions. While experimental data provide the most important handle on the conformational variability that the system is experiencing, they usually report on either time or ensemble averages. Since the available conformations largely outnumber the (independent) available experimental data, the latter can be equally well reproduced by a variety of ensembles. We have proposed the Maximum Occurrence (MaxOcc) approach to provide an upper bound of the statistical weight of each conformation. This method is expected to converge towards the true statistical weights by increasing the number of independent experimental datasets. In this paper we explore the ability of DEER (Double Electron Electron Resonance) data, which report on the distance distribution between two spin labels attached to a biomolecule, to restrain the MaxOcc values and its complementarity to previously introduced experimental techniques such as NMR and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering. We here present the case of Ca2+ bound calmodulin (CaM) as a test case and show that DEER data impose a sizeable reduction of the conformational space described by high MaxOcc conformations.},
